It’s already there… ### UV LED driver (Craig) - No questions ### DCDC coil order (Carl) - Barrel (Timon) happy to sign-off - (Tony/Craig) Would need to be run passed Uli for BMBF part - (Tony/Craig) Need to run past Didier et al. - can be done along with the passive components - Dennis also says he is happy if Timon is happy - Ulli happy - (Craig) what are the QC steps? Satish answers (Carl/Satish/Timon to write document): - Magnet tests at Yale - Irradiation at BNL - Temperature range at LBL - Solder joint Yale/LBL - Purchasing of components for production - Barrel powerboards - no (preprod first, then production) - Barrel hybrids - no (on 12 month cycle with company) - EC - no - Review office happy for us not to qualify all passives ### AoB - None ## Actions 1.

LEMO) if people prefer that to home-made cables - Mini display port labelling - Labels are provided on the transport frames - silk screen on PCB is hidden by transport frame - Labels to be included on the PCB silk screen in case of running without transport frame in place (not recommended procedure!) ### Barrel transport frame (Gerrit) - Ribbing was added (optimised?) by the injection moulding
