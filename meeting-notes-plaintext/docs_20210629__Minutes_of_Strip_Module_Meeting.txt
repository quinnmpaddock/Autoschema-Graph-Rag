# 29/06/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1032186/ 
### Introduction
- Apart from some banter on the football EM nothing to report
- I lied:
 - Hybrid bonding and Module bonding docs in final EDMS short review and will be approved in coming days
 - Next week HVtab and hybrid metrology to follow
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R0 tool production
 - Metrology about to wrap up
 - To be sent out this week
 - Spares to remain in Freiburg
 - In parts these are failed parts to be remade
 - Expect 4 weeks at least for having complete spares set of good tools available
- R3 tool production
 - Tools to Freiburg, DESY and Upsala sent
 - These are all that are to be sent
 - Few tools (to remain in Ca) to be optimised still, dummy modules being built for testing
 - About done with tools :)
 - Expect to wrap up next week with final tools
- R4 tool production
 - Company is reworking, have identified problem with hole positioning
 - Company has to drill out bad holes larger then insert metal and drill proper hole
 - Currently waiting for company “done by” date
- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out
 - all parts for beta setups finished and will be shipped this week
 - talk about cooling next week
 - Production of full setup will begin once beta testers reported back
- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation
 - Postponed to next week due to test beam in parallel right now
- EC multiple module box transport box
 - Waiting for mechanical bonded module for final shipping test
 - Current box model in in Ca, waiting for return or time in workshop to build a new one (workshop currently overbooked)
 - HH to build a mechanical module for the shipping tests
- Production of bonding and testing jigs
 - See task tracker… 
- Production of LED bars
 - Postponed to next week due to test beam in parallel right now
- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order
 - SMD population at company, slower progress than usual
 - Company should stay open over summer holidays
 - Also Freiburg should be covered for reception tests
### ITSDAQ Updates
- Json file - does it also have a run number?
 - The json file uses the ITSDAQ runnumber that is also stored in the var directory
 - Run number increments locally at each test station independently
 - Test data uploaded to DB includes both the local run number and given test station, which allows to cross correlate with local additional data
- This way the runnumbers for a given module, passing though different test stations, will not be sequential
 - Yes, it is a number for the test stand, not for the module
- One could also have a sequential run number for each module
 - Yes, but with test stand + local run number this works too and needs no additional external DB query
 - One can time order the tests using the DB time info
- In prod there might be the need to upload data later (if network issues exist for example)
 - Yes, ITSDAQ is to create the json file with all required info, which can then be uploaded right away or later if needed
- Will ITSDAQ need a DB connection to do this automated work?
 - To be sorted, but will need some DB info and will sort how to best do this
- Andy: maybe query DB once a week to download required data?
 - Depends if you create hybrids or modules - once hybrid is already registered this could work
- When will this feature be available?
 - Working on some issues right now, then will get back to implementing the json output and adjust DB if needed
 - Is structure for the tests in DB already defined? For strobe for example?
 - Strobe might not change, but FUSEids addition and SW tag / git info / FW version will require some additions
 - For 3pt gain needs per strip info added
### HV tabbing and SQ requirements
- Discussion about which parameters to aim for
 - 300g/500g seems a lot, is it really required?
 - Is better for module mounting, the higher this is
- Do we need more sites to show that these parameters are achievable before we go for site quali with these target parameters?
- Bart: has anyone looked at sensor performance with these settings in terms of damages?
 - SCIPP has build 4 modules with this and has not seen any sensor damage
- Conclusion: leave 300g as target for SQ, might change when more sites start getting experience
 - We should add strain relief to petal / stave
 - We will do dip tests to see if this is required, might show that we do not need such high shear strength
- Page 8: ±200 microns is for stave/petal mounting, so should not be released
 - Position is harder to obtain for barrel with current jigging
 - Bart has developed a 3D printed helper tool to improvements
- SQ deliverables
 - Did you include pre and post tabbing IV test?
 - Yes! Is included also including DB upload
 - DB actions are on page 13 of talk, please check
### R5 tooling metrology
- Toronto and Vancouver sent separately please and spares to Toronto
- Tested all tools for relative fit as well
### Metrology Update
- Page 12: do not key but rely on everyone to stick with what order is defined in metrology document
- 
### [move to next week] Tuning channel classification criteria for the ABCStar chipset
- 
### AOB
- none
