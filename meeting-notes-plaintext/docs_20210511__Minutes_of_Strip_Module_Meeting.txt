# 11/05/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1032179/ 
### Introduction
- More EDMS reviews will start today/tomorrow
- Task force has looked at some documents and site qualification spreadsheet will be updated this week for review
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- Production of the common jigs required in the EC
 - All is in production
 - Expected delivery date in 1 month
 - Will re-confirm date with Oscar
- Production of R0 and R1 test frames for the EC
 - Dennis did not yet sign them off
 - Expect all tested with hybrids by mid next week
- Production of R2 test frames for the EC
 - Hybrid has been tested
 - Module noise is not yet confirmed
 - Hold “ok” until we know they work ok with modules
 - Expected in about 4 weeks
 - Mini display port connector might be supply limited (a month ago it was in good supply, lead time 5 weeks)
 - RFID - have 18-30 week lead time delay
 - Sites who make frames should order the RFIDs in that case
 - PCB makers might still have sufficient local supply, check with them first
- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames
 - R3 checked with hybrids (R4, 5 still in pipeline)
 - Final design expected by planned vendor
 - Check for RFIDs
- Production of LED bars for the EC
 - Merged all flexes into one array
 - Connector is not yet in correct place, need to repair
### Hybrid QC test coupons
- Craig: 7 hybrid proposal looks sensible, but needs approval from review office. New coupon-less proposal might be too much of a change
- Ingo: smaller coupons might be a way out if funding really becomes an issue, but need to make sure everything is consistent with EC
 - Ashley: will add via chains on tabs to help if there are issues
- Forest: only one coupon out of 3 that survives, need to test via chains on tabs; but can’t reflow hybrids as many times as hybrids
 - Ashley: the batch test of 10 cycles on one coupon should be sufficient to qualify a panel, but need to be checked
- Andy: does it change the amount of hybrids that are marked as failed when a single coupon fails?
 - Becomes only an issue if two coupons per panel are crossed-out circuits, but need to discuss with manufacturer (and part of procurement document)
- Bart: cost penalty for priming order
 - Craig: only an issue if hybrids fail in PRR, otherwise no issue
 - Tony: might consider to change drop rate
 - Ashley: can be an issue with QC, so need to look at it; main issue is pull tests
 - Craig: if pull-test becomes an issue, it’s likely that this will be dropped after pre-production to help (if evidence is good enough to support this)
 - Ashley: need also look how this is affected by SMD population
- Forest: the option to have coupons interleaved in hybrid panel has benefits and is not much of an change; we should add these extra QC pieces in
 - Craig: but then have to change the automated system and also need to make sure this does not affect cost
 - Ashley: testing these structures is some significant work to do
- Craig: no disagreement to change to one coupon per array and EC has same proposal
 - Dennis: happy with this change; but thinks change to small coupons might be a lot of work to implement (even the via chains on hybrid tab)
 - Craig/Ashley: also not too sure how much change is allowed in the procurement process / hybrid tendering
- Question for Tony: process to get this through review process
 - Tony: need to flesh this more out: what are the effects of crossed-out coupons; what changes for LBL; number of vias; how to justify not doing test coupon tests after SMD (reflow at SMD is not more aggressive than the one done for QC; but could consider to leave one coupon on panel instead of doing 5 reflow for QC)

### Star DAQboards - updated!
- Soo cool: new member in the PCB adapter family - PCIe - module data adapter board
 - PCIe MDA 
- Are the PB connections very different
 - yes
- Should institutes donate their spare SLVS boards?
 - Absolutely, that’s why we kept asking to fill out the survey
 - Will be discussed in Production Planning meeting on Thursday
### Dummy powerboards for the endcap
- Jonas: like to get part of orders for 3D printed powerboards, but haven’t looked into doing this ourselves
 - Luise: have heard from several sites looking into making them, but so far not heard any news
- Step files for powerboards are available on EDMS with correct shapes and SMD components
- Carles: they are not cheap, but it would be worth it; will look into how to pay for this
- Luise: would be good if everyone discuss in their institutes and discuss it on Thursday (similar to procurement of glass sensors)
### AOB
- None
