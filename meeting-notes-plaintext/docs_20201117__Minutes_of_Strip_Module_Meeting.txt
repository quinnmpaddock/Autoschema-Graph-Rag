# 17/11/20 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/927528/ 
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- None
### Task tracker items
- R1 tool production Urgent Late
 - 70% done, ready to be shipped in ~3 weeks
 - Re-report 2-3 weeks time
- R2 tool production Urgent Late
 - Drawings being done (with delay, holidays..), expect finished next week
 - Rereport in 2 weeks
- Barrel hybrid tendering/order Urgent In progress
 - Reviewing currently CAM data for first thinflex hybrids (not tendered)
 - No delivery date until approved
 - For tendering only labelling on circuits (silk screen) should change
- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation Urgent Late
 - Comments from Ash
 - No Kambiz, put up again next week
- EC module test frame finalisation Urgent Late
 - EDMS review launched
- Barrel module testframe finalisation Normal Late
 - Ash awaiting feedback
 - Seems UK still has most modules in old frames
- EC hybrid panel transport box finalisation Normal Late
 - Not all designs are yet ready but can be finished fast
 - See slides for production status
 - Transparent material can be the requested alternative
 - Marc will update the drawings to drop the bottom (change holes diameter, fix placement of screws)
- Production of bonding and testing jigs Urgent In progress
- Production of R0 and R1 test frames Urgent In progress
- Production of R2 test frames Urgent In progress
- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames Urgent In progress
- Production of hybrid panel cover Urgent In progress
- Production of stencils Urgent In progress
- Production of LED bars Urgent In progress
- Supply of pins and bushings Urgent In progress
 - Should arrive next week
- Supply of miscellaneous EC tool common items Urgent In progress
 - Most of the things arrived, some are missing
 - E.g RFID is missing
 - Should be ready to ship out for xmas
- Production of module frame cover Urgent In progress
 - Christian not there today
- Production of handling frame (foam) for test frames and hybrid panel Urgent In progress
 - 
### Visual inspection - summary of discussion in last QC meet
- Agreed as new baseline
### Reception testing procedures for sensors 
- Make sure IV test is identical to sensor site reception IV
- Fix error in leakage: less than 0.1 muA/cm^2!
- Clarify: 3 month criterion means that you redo the IV before you use the sensor once it has been in storage for more than 3 months (NOT do IV every 3 months!)
- Discussion.. Lots of back and forthâ€¦ 
- We will have to track during preprod to get a better idea if we will build up piles of potentially bad sensors due to humidity effects or not
 - Bake out can usually fix the sensors and we currently expect that rather a large set of sensors will need bake out to recover
 - To be continued
 - Bart;s impression may be skewed due to long timeframe between initial tests and production by HPK - hopefully things will look better when we do not have such long corona induced wait periods
- Proposal (no one complained): if a sensor is found to have an early-ish breakdown, it is supposed to be stored in dry storage, with us much air exposure as possible, and re-tested every two weeks for two months, if it does not recover, a bake out shall be attempted
- This is not the plan for production, but a dedicated study to be performed during pre-production to find a protocol to be used during production, specifically:
 - Do sensors with humidity issues experience more problems further down the line and should therefore be baked out straight away
 - What is the recommended dry storage period after seeing a problem
 - What is the yield loss due to humidity issues
### Concerns with humidity sensors for the cold box
- Do not use SHT85 for long 0% measurements
- Better use HYT939 that continues to measure dew point reliably
### AOB
- EC noise tests
 - Some modules improved by added low impedance path / DC path
 - R2 did not improve enough (for R2 PB had not yet been glued, but is now, no change)
 - PB specific localised noise is currently not studied
 - PBs are of older type without latest fixes
 - However the HV return path will not be changed on the PB in newer versions
 - Dennis will provide noise plots and list of changes before AUW to module list
 - 20 minute slot to be reserved by Tony for AUW
- PCI panel power/data adaptor PCBs have been tested at Liverpool. Parts for endcap will be shipped to Freiburg, to be distributed from there.
