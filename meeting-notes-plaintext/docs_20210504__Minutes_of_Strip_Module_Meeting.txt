# 04/05/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1008271/ 
### Introduction
- SQ steps for Hybrid reception, module shipping and storage ready for qualification
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
### Endcap Tool RFID 
- Proposal: change EC RFID tool tags to single layer design to improve readability
 - Valencia happy to solder them there
 - Podding changes readability a lot (gets worse)
 - Other issue is with american frequency. American freqs canâ€™t be used in Europe and the other way round because of spectra usage (mobile, military..)
### A common test for IV curves
- Header information: scripts in database to extract all components at current institute into text file and use this as look-up file
- There is no requirement to immediately upload files directly after the test
 - Bruce: need to support upload at a later point (even though database access should be available at all times);
 - Might be more problematic if there are restrictions on the work environment (e.g. from cleanroom)
 - Vitaliy: QC code is not just for uploading, but also for data inspection and other features
- Sensor envelope has also the printed serial number below the barcode
- Vitaliy: SCIPP is not using LabVIEW;
- Gerrit: item 1 is hard to realize to get all groups using a limited number of measurement software
- Luise: different output format for sensor IV and module IV. can this be implemented in already existing measurement software?
 - Vitaliy: yes, SCIPP system can be adapted
 - Luise: would be good if sensor QC sites could keep using their software for IV measurements by just modifying the output format
- Vitaliy: groups need to ensure that all groups adhere to certain measurement routines and safety procedures
- Vitaliy asks Bart: how to UK tests sensors after HV-tabbing
 - Bart: using Prague code, which includes shut voltage; use same setup for all measurements (HV-tabbed sensors and bare sensors)
 - Shunt voltage field is already in database for sensor IV test
 - Would be good to keep in case it is used by some groups
- Christoph: would be good to define a new test type for IV after HV-tabbing
 - Bart: should be as close to sensor IV as possible to compare results of module IV with sensor IV
- Question: does IV of sensor with HV tab belongs to sensor or to module?
 - Add information in file header as comment
 - Gerrit: better to have a flag or a new test type
 - This is not only relevant for test after HV tab, but also when items are shipped
- Luise: would be good to propose a file header design in next 2 weeks and discuss it
- Need also ensure to make sure extraction algorithms work for all possible IV measurement output files
 - Extraction of derived parameters is happening during database upload (for sensor QC)
 - Luise: would be good to test this to make sure e.g. current is not too noisy for algorithm to find breakdown voltage
- Need a more complete list of systems people are planning on using
- Need to check that current systems are compatible with IV file analysis 
### Waffle Wedges for Tab Bonding
- Asked community to notify with wedges are used for tab bonding
 - Mainly waffle tools used
- Tab will break at 480g (tensile strength)
- Propose to require using a waffle tool for tab bonding in documentation
- Recommendation: should to all tab bonding in one session to minimize tool changing
 - Keeping in mind that there are QC tests required before bonding a tab
### AOB
- None, out of time
