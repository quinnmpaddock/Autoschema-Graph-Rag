# 09/03/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1008265/ 
### Introduction
- RAL might have found a way to ship wafer faster than anticipated (in 1-2 weeks)
- Tony A. gives update about HCC size increase
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
- R0 tool production
 - Back in workshop for final assembly of pins
 - Missing bushings expected to arrive in next days
 - When first set is ready, do metrology and build a test object
 - Not easy to estimate about when tools are ready for distribution
- US hybrid/module tool production
 - Shipped tools that need re-machining
- UK/China hybrid/module tool production
 - Tools expected back from rework today to RAL
 - After shipping to Liverpool, do final inspection of reworked features
 - Need to modify pick-up tools to fix design issue
 - Next report in 3 weeks
- US powerboard tool production
 - Report next week
- EC PPA/prototype hybrid order
 - Most are SMD populated, reordered some types to get full PPA quantities
 - Hybrids need to be cleaned (water spots after manufacturer cleaning); will be done at Freiburg
 - Plan for assembly vendor to do cleaning? Yes, if they can do without water spots. Need further discussion with vendor.
 - Barrel has opted for no-clean process because this is now industry standard
 - 3 weeks for sending them out
- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)
 - Tasktracker updated by Carles
 - No triangle shipping, need to check impact for all countries 
 - All shipments might need to go through CERN
 - So far all countries checked (China, Canada, Spain) answered question about “what counts as modification” with a statement that assembling hybrids/modules would fall under modification of material and therefore prevent temporary import/export schemes (currently getting double checked in Canada)
 - Need to get this checked for every country involved
- Barrel hybrid tendering/order
 - Discussion between Ashley and Graphic about copper thickness of inner layers
 - Need to wait for QA of thinflex circuits with thinner copper process.
 - A few weeks until decision can be made
 - Gerrit: would this affect the mechanical stability?
 - Graphic thinks the thinner copper will result in better circuit
 - Availability of raw material is the critical part for PPB hybrid production, not specification
 - (delivery issues with Dupont)
- EC hybrids/powerboard tendering
 - Weekly meetings to discuss progress
- Endcap module thermal cycling setup
 - First EDMS review still open
 - Couple of missing drawings and couple of clarifications required
 - Sergio: close review, update drawings and open again (either to accept it or for short review)
 - DESY workshops 
 - Outsource machining
 - All DESY workshops had been temporarily closed; back open, but large backlog -> try to push boxes priority
 - Have to finish few manufacturing drawings (very soon)
 - New update in 1 month
 - Gerrit: need electrical brakes in plumbing to jigs but need to be careful that they don’t leak at low temperature
 - Not sure if needed because full box is floating
 - Grounding in peltier-based boxes is different than for non-peltier boxes
 - Want to isolate chiller from box
 - Endcap cold-box design allows for breaks outside of box if required
 - William: do modules need to fulfill noise specs in cold box
 - Craig: yes, so far all tests show that it is possible; need to see after first tests how the noise behaves
- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation
 - Re-ordered R2 arrived today
 - R3 testing in progress, looks mostly OK
 - Karola: Dortmund need to spend money soon, so would be good to get feedback when they can order the parts
- Production of bonding and testing jigs (EC)
 - Waiting for design of test jigs from Sergio -> less than 2 weeks probably
- Production of R0 and R1 test frames
 - Update in 2 weeks
- Production of R2 test frames
 - Update in 2 weeks
- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames
 - Update in 2 weeks
- Production of hybrid panel cover
 - Order additional pieces because of threaded inserts?
 - Some holes are close to edges, which increases risk when push-fitting inserts
 - Gerrit: tested lots of inserts and all pushed parts damaged the polycarbonate. Only heat-fitted inserts worked reliably.
 - Should try test pieces with different hole sizes to find best match
 - Timeline for final delivery?
 - First parts need to be ready in 6-8 weeks
 - Full set has more time
- Production of stencils (EC)
 - Liv not in meeting
- Production of LED bars for the EC
 - Issue with LED PCBs not fitting in jigs
 - Working on design update and Re-ordered
- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order
 - Flexes in hand, go to SMD population
 - Next update in 2 weeks
### Long-Term Humidity Study (Vitaliy)
- Assumption that modules will be in dry storage, but not during assembly
 - Stave assembly done in 2 days without dry storage, but can be longer if issues arise (up to approximately a week)
 - Might have to look into how to mitigate longer exposure during assembly
- William: Is there a plan to do tests with keeping modules dry (e.g. to check for other impacts on modules)	
 - Preproduction sensors have been kept dry for a long time
 - Some experience across community with modules from prototype phase
 - More concern about modules than for sensors about dry storage impac
 - This test particularly to look for sensors, not modules
### EC ASIC Misalignment (Luise/Sergey)
- Fiducials are not aligned to sensor position (or sensor position is not aligned to fiducials)
- ASIC centres are aligned to centre of landing pad
 - Kambiz will provide dimensions of fiducials with respect to landing pad centre
### AOB
- None
