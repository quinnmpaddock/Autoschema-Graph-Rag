# 15/03/2022 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1109672/
### Introduction
- Part Release:
 - PM/AC team needs to be informed if a group is ready to receive parts for PPA/PPB. They then will release the parts (PM team for the number of parts)
 - Bart: would thought this was more for the cluster manager to decide?
 - Luise: this is a lot easier for barrel than for ECIn barrel the cluster managers can/will organise part distribution within clusterThis does not work for EC, where parts are distributed across different clusters
- Visual Inspection:
 - Vitaliy: might be good to re-take the IV, if it was done only once
- EC modules:
 - Andy: did the previous “Frankenstein” modules had high noise?
 - Dennis: there were higher noise, but not as extreme as Luise. On the test frame the noise was higher than on the petal.
- GS: what is the news for the availability of ABCStarV1 for PPB?
 - Craig: first batch of probed ASICs are on route to DA (diced)Arrival from dicing vendor to DA is imminent.Second batch of wafers is to be diced soon
 - GS: when should the first ASICs arrive at the sites?
 - Craig: once they arrive, shipping will happen as soon as possible.
- Tony: review of burn in, does it include the database section as well?
 - Luise: yes
- Tony: hybrid test is approved, will this be released soon?
 - Luise: later in meeting
- William: is hybrid burn in deployed and available to be used?
 - Dennis: can confirm that all EC hybrid panels can be run in crate
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates

- 22/03/2022: Barrel tasks
- 29/03/2022: EC tasks
- R0 tool production
No news
- R1 tool production
New tools made and produced, should have improved heights and better fit
- R2 tool production
Remaining tools sent out, waiting for sites to confirm they’re happy
- R4 tool production
Remaining tools delivered, metrology done, to be sent out
- Powerboard testing setup roll-out
No news
- Endcap module thermal cycling setup
Being distributed
- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation
Review ongoing
- Production of R0 and R1 test frames
- Production of R2 test frames
- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames
Review ongoing
- Production of stencils
Prague looking into it
- PPB Module for April Irradiation
Dedicated discussion at the end of meeting
### Institute Contributions
Glasgow
- Timon: The failing test is a temperature measurement. There is a fix for some of the tight thresholds, especially the temperature measurement since this can depend on the environment temperature.
- Vitaliy: outlet to spread the flow of dry air would be good
- Luise: maybe share design of new module box on a Twiki page if other people want to copy?
Prague
- No questions
Adelaide
- Not sure if they need a microscope for visual inspection -> yes, need one
- Luise: would also probably be possible to provide some parts to progress the site qualification
Next week: BNL, UiO, DESY-Z
### GUIs for metrology and wire bonding uploads
- Theo: there is a program that does the analysis for barrel modules, so can be nice to combine the two
- Kenneth: do you take the test schema from the database, or is it hard coded?
 - Graham: it is hard coded in the python
- Luise: the goal is to have an interface that can upload the required raw data files to the database
 - Graham can help with that part, just send an email
### Update: hybrid test result upload
- Luise: beta-testing phase of the database upload for hybrid test into databasWould be nice if groups could try using them and give feedback to Bruce and Christian
- Luise: when the instructions are ready, will release the step for site qualification
### Testbeam module planning
- Luise: need to build several modules for this
 - 2 modules for irradiation campaign at CERN in MaySS module at Liverpool, R1 module at DESY
 - Is this doable at DESY-Z?
 - Carl: should be able to do this
 - ASICs from Prague, sensor should be in hand, powerboard from Freiburg
 - SS module at Liverpool
 - Powerboard from Timon
- Luise: Also prepare an irradiated R0 module as backup in case the irradiation causes any issues
 - OK to not pre-irradiate the ASICs
 - Is there a way to get an irradiated R0 sensor?
 - Have to find someone to build the irradiated module (maybe Valencia?)
