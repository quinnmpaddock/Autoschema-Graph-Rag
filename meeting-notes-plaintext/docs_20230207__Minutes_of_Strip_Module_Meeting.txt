### Introduction
Slide 4
- Ben: what does the LBNL QT for burn-in includes?
 - Luise: a couple of different things: using AMAC for readout, some small improvements
 - Ben: OK, I’m also working on GUI side, would be good to coordinate this
 - Ben: would be good to get into contact
- Kenny: if things should involve we-app, I would like to be included as well
Slide 6
- Sven: it is only one pair that needs to be swapped. We have done 6 in the picture to test the crossing.
- Tony: had a request from Peter to do some delay changes. Is Peter doing this at RAL?
 - Peter: would be good if you can do this as well
 - Peter: will do it on single chip boards as well
 - Tony: Peter asked to look at delay settings and … settings and see if there are combinations that don’t work
- William: is there something on a bare hybrid that can be done to test this?
 - Peter: it’s simply the pipeline does not work with a particular duty cycle. To increase the working margin of the pipeline we want to change the duty cycle
 - Peter: before inversion, HCC is controlling rising edge, now it would be falling edge. There is a minor temperature effect
 - William: is there a test on the hybrid that we can do to test this margin?
 - Peter: can measure on a hybrid that the duty cycle is as we want. SCIPP has shown that with the inversion the fine delay can still be 50
 - Peter: if you use 1.1V chip voltage you will see lost signal
 - Luise: this test is to show that after the swop we can still test hybrids reliably (no issues with readout)
 - William: question is if we do this in a lot of hybrid
 - Luise: we wait for the results before deciding on how to go forward
Slide 8
- Vitaliy: did you also want to look into chemical composition change?
 - Luise: want, yes; but need to find someone who can do this (apart from a company)
- Tony: heard idea: has the water content of the components any impact? Would pre-baking maybe help?
 - Luise: thought I heard you can see it in the un-mixed components
 - Tony: yes, so you could pre-backe the un-mixed components
 - Peter: its really hard to tell before mixing, but after mixing it is obvious
 - Luise: would the idea be to pre-backe the unmixed glues first
 - Peter: we could probably try this. We have a batch that probably looks different.
- Andy: is there a variation between batches or is it a binary thing?
 - Luise: don’t know yet. Need to collect information to look at this
 - Andy: do we know how many people have seen this discolouration?
 - Luise: that is why we ask people to provide information
 - Dennis: have seen this on a batch, that was expired 3 years ago.
- In chat: Kirsten: our grey batch does not expire until May 2023
 - Peter: same here
Slide 9
- Jaya John: if this is possible, it would be nice to test the crossed wires
Slide 5
- Bruce: does people tried to debug things and didn’t communicate this? Any information is useful. If you see the message, something is going wrong and we need to fix it. Please provide feedback.

### [pending] end-cap powerboard test results
Slide 
- Luise: for R1 modules, these are the old powerboards, not the updated version. We know there is some weirdness with those
- Luise: the green line in plots is the noise at room temperature
 - Tony: and the red is the maximum allowed?
 - Cole: unlike barrel module, the noise values are different for each segment
 - Tony: looks like that on the away you are closer than on the under
 - Luise: its because of the different strip lengths
 - Cole: left and right for R4/R5 should have the same noise
 - Luise: there is also different area coverage
- Vitaliy: interesting comparison, looks like cold to warm should be about 0.85, which is interesting to see
- Vitaliy: were any of the modules that show cold noise breakdown?
 - Cole: no, I recorded the current and it looked good
 - Luise: no, but M13 had higher sensor current
- Vitaliy: what glue were they build with?
 - Luise: all R4/R5 were build with polaris; R1 (R10 - 12) with polaris, R13 with SE4445
 - Vitaliy: that was the module with larger cold noise?
 - Cole: no, that was 11. It looks like cold noise, but cold noise usually looks different
 - Cole: SE4445 does have this one weird behaviour, but still looking into this
 - Cole: more likely that there is an error that needs to be found
 - Vitaliy: for 11, it would be interesting to see what is going on
 - Cole: yes, worth doing
- Vitaliy: on slide 7 you had several peaks at room temperature.
 - Luise: there are several spots where this shows up. Might be low isolation issue. Not likely that it is the pick-up tool.
 - Luise: we only handle the sensors from the bottom, don’t use vacuum suction cups.
 - Bart: maybe try to use a de-ionizer to see if this helps
 - Luise: we can look into this later on, but since these are the away strips it is not an urgent issue
- Andy: is there something related to different noise levels with different powerboards?
 - Luise: we want to look into which powerboard version to use. Ideally choose the one with the best performance
 - Andy: would then the same type of powerboard be used for all variants?
 - Luise: yes, but it could also be that we choose different variations for different module types
 - Dennis: would prefer one common version
 - Andy: ?????????
 - Luise: there is no cold noise for this one, it’s just noise. We are not worried about cold noise right now
 - Andy: if we have a solution, will there be cold noise that increases noise?
 - Luise: this is the first cold cycle that we have. We want to get to 10 cold cycles to verify this. The goal is to have low noise at room temperature and if possible no cold noise
- Tony: could you add the temperature that you test at on the slides?
- Tony: could you shunt the modules at cold temperatures?
 - Cole: it is planned
- Tony: can we also have hybrid layout/geometry information?
 - Dennis: for all these R4/R5 its a different via structure than for R1
 - Tony: we need to know what the difference is (and also compared to barrel)
 - Peter: new end-cap powerboards use staggered vias, barrel powerboards used stacked vias, so the comparison would be very interesting
 - Tony: the hybrid might have an impact as well
 - Peter: most significant difference is the powerboard
 - Dennis: there is also a difference in vias: some are epoxy filled, some are copper filled
 - Tony: the via drill sizes might be different as well. It would be good to have the information together
 - Cole: happy to include this in the slides
 - Ashley: the stackup for the powerboard is the same as the EC hybrid?
 - Dennis: no, it’s not
 - Ashely: is yours thicker than the hybrids?
 - Dennis: no, same thickness, but for random reasons: inner is different from outer
 - Ashley: but your circuits are ~100um thinner than barrel?
 - Dennis: yes, thickness is only 270 microns
 - Ash: that’s a significant difference which may also play a part
 - Tony: we should grab the powerboard layout from Timon too
 - D
- Luise: EC cold boxes are much warmer than US cold boxes. We might want to test the modules colder to see if cold noise shows up. Would anyone in the US barrel be able to help testing those modules?
 - Tony: for colder results would have to go to BNL or LBNL.
 - Vitaliy: but the jig is different
 - Luise: could make an adapter to make this working
 - Peter: for a one-off test we could probably overdrive the peltier
 - Cole: could probably do this for a single module, but it becomes really inefficient and the chiller can’t dissipate the heat ending in the end
 - Dennis: dry ice?
 - Cole: was thinking about this
 - Luise: if we add dry ice, would this result in a colder chuck?
 - Dennis: we can get cold noise with dry ice (cooling the air)
 - Cole: is might also help what the cooling performance
 - Paul: we have done this for single chip setups. But it is hard to tell which actual temperature you are running at
 - Luise: concern is that we don’t kow what exactly is cooled and in testbeam box there have been weird noise effects with dry ice cooling
 - Cole: agree that it could be problematic
- Tony: thought we had cold noise on EC modules before?
 - Luise: different powerboard version
 - Dennis: but the R1 is not so much different. Separate submission, but same design
 - Luise: on R1 we also see almost no cold noise
 - Dennis: will check design, by Thursday, but there was cold noise in testbeam
- Luise; what results do we need for final decision about powerboard version
 - Luise: cold cycles?
 - Dennis: yes
 - Tony: is there any logic why the powerboard peaks look much higher than barrel?
 - Dennis: yes, will be easier sitting in the same room
 - Tony: looks a bit like the when we had the coil orientation different (slide 12)
 - Luise; do we need magnetic triggering?
 - Dennis: not necessary, but might be nice
 - Luise: for the R1 where we see something like cold noise, it might be interesting on those
 - Cole: OK
