https://indico.cern.ch/event/1032182/ 
### Introduction
- New steps released for SQ
 - X, Y, Z
- Next up
 - A, B, C
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R0 tool production
 - Progress with metrology
 - Test glueing of hybrids worked well with randomly picked tools
 - about time scales, facing issues with metrology
 - issues with keyence wrt temperature control (temperature in cleanroom not controlled enough currently, keyence affected (loses calibration) by less than +-1Â°C variations)
 - Discussion about when to release tools
 - Discussion also about in or out of spec
 - They can measure it but it takes a long time
 - There will be a report by Freiburg next week to see what sub set of tools can already be sent to other sites
- R3 tool production
 - Working on DB upload RFID tool tag
 - Worried on adding errors due to current manual nature of RFID scanning
 - Sven copied RFID into text file
 - Working on DB upload of metrology data as well
 - Hybrids built with each toolset and they were in spec :)
 - Some people have to learn using the tools
 - Some pins needed to be re-optimised
 - Mech modules maybe already by end of week
- EC PPA/prototype hybrid order
 - Some progress
 - RFID addition to DB ongoing
 - Unsure how long this will take
 - Cleaning open
 - Would hope to ship within 2 weeks
- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)
 - This is just a reminder also tracked in prod planning meet
- Barrel hybrid tendering/order
 - Converging on hybrid tender specs
 - Contract to be signed in coming weeks
 - Sorting out 
 - DuPont non availability details
 - Test coupon adjustments
- EC hybrids/powerboard tendering
 - No news on prod tender, Uli is on holiday
 - Dennis will check with Kambiz if all Fr changes were made and the tender docs are now in CERN hands
- Endcap module thermal cycling setup
 - See slides
 - Holdup: external jig firm bailed, new company contacted
- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out
 - Final tweaks done, working on small subset to be sent to beta sites
 - All parts machined for first crate, will be tested this week, then one more week to prepare parts for the beta sites
 - No news from the fan company, will now go for the fans at triple price
 - Fans used, for order of beta test sites:https://noctua.at/de/nf-a6x25-pwm/specification 
- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation
 - New silk screen being iterated, closing on finalisation
 - Should arrive on EDMS this week
- EC multiple module box transport box
 - Expected to circulate a mech star module, but repairs of HH bonder required, will add delay for shipping test
 - All parts for final shipping test available
- Production of the common jigs required in the EC
 - Work progressing according to plan, no speed bumps hit
- Production of stencils for the EC
 - Stencil files to be added to dedicated folder in EDMS
 - Old ones have to be removed from previous location
 - New files to be immediately approved on upload
 - Marc will sort this with Craig
- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order
 - Population details clarified with company
 - Cost estimate to arrive tomorrow
 - Company is preparing population
All sites please purchase all the required Nexys and Genesys G2 boards NOW! (global shortage of Si parts makes unavailability, in the near future, likely - see e.g. the MicroZed board (current delivery time: 52 weeks))
### Reclassification for the ABCStarv1 wafers probed by Carleton
- Test fixes recovered a lot of ASICs in the maps, please use updated probing maps
### End-cap coldbox PCB
- Lund will check if they can include the humidity sensors in their order and deliver to sites
### AMAC current measurement & referencing caps
- Dave postponed to next week
### AOB
- n
