# 15/06/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1032184/
### Introduction
- We congratulate Craig for becoming our next project leader :-)
- First electrical tool build modules (slides)
 - William needs the panel jigs of all flavours to bond the hybrids
 - As soon as sensor batches get ok to be send out, Canada will initiate shipment back and forth to CERN to import them permanently to Canada
 - Will be followed up offline, but Tony officially requests the release now
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R0 tool production
 - About to send parts (4 sets of tools) out
 - to Ca, one set def next week
 - Other 3 to follow the week after
 - Other toolsets need further metrology work
- R1 tool production
 - Tools have been distributed
 - Task not yet completed as not all toolsets have been sent yet
 - Also new RFID tags not shipped with tools
- R3 tool production
 - 46 parts sent to Freiburg, should arrive tomorrow
 - Finished DESY tools, expect ready for delivery by end of this week
 - LED bars? Mechanical supports come from Freiburg?
 - Yes, they come from Freiburg
- R4 tool production
 - Some pins do not fit the bushings, iterating with company
 - Pins fit into bushings outside of tool
 - Positions or angles of holes might be at fault
 - Rest of metrology looks good
- EC PPA/prototype hybrid order
 - Hybrids are cleaned, not yet in DB
 - RFID spreadsheet is prepared
 - Ca hybrids for fast track modules are sent
- Endcap module thermal cycling setup
 - Work ongoing, progressing
- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out
 - Further tests have been performed
 - Cooling works well
 - Parts for beta testers nearly finished, will send by end of week
 - Will to to RAL, Liv, Toronto, SCIPP, please send shipping addresses
 - Fan procurement?
 - Manufacturer is lacking parts
 - Ordered from supplier, expect few week delivery time
- Production of bonding and testing jigs
 - All in prod
 - Bonding jigs prioritised
 - Testing jigs to follow
 - Stencils are also in prod, should be pushed in prio if possible
- Production of LED bars
 - Focussed on hybrids and shipping last week, no progress on LED bars yet, next thing up
- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order
 - Order placed for SMD populations, waiting for return of boards
### Coldjig software scheduling
- Influx and grafana run where?
 - Assuming to run on another PC
- How does data from there end up in DB?
 - Discussing with Christian Appelt and Bruce Gallop
 - ITSDAQ will run scripts after test finalisation and upload the data also from the local influx instance
- Which versions of grafana / influx?
 - There is a new python influx lib which can talk with 1.8 and 2.0, so we get out of the release catch
 - Some recommendations?
 - Not really no strong prefs and lib above gets out out of the 1 vs 2 issue
 - It is not gonna work for influx 1.7! Need 1.8 at least
- For the releases - will you inform the module list? And what if things slip?
 - Yes will send email to module list when new release is made
 - Maybe add tasktracker items for each of the release versions?
 - That sounds good!
### Hybrid Package Height
- Spec we have is on glue height +-40µm but doesn’t take total package height into account
- Even with tools specs being +-10µm, operator error can resolve in deviations bigger than 20µm
- If we only measure glue height (and it is within +-40µm), the total package height might still be off by more than 20µm
- Tony thinks taking into account measurement uncertainties and biases in measurement, we need to allow larger deviations than 20µm
- Craig suggestion: Make sure people measure everything during pre-production on assembly jig, allow 40µm deviations, figure out with more statistics if it has to be tightened 
 - Important to see effects of measuring on panel or on jig (and how this would affect workflow)
- Kirsten proposal: measure ASIC glue thickness as before, only to stack-up measurement if glue thickness is lower than 80um
 - Craig: issue is that this only will be measured when something fails, so we will not get enough statistic
- Gerrit: would be best to do measurements on hybrid assembly jigs and this will not affect flow too much; propose to do measurements in pre-production always on jigs
 - Maybe do it also on panel and compare results
- Craig: during pre-production rates are not so high, so can do measurements on hybrid assembly jig
- Vitaliy: would need to have a special jig to do metrology of multiple hybrids in a single go (e.g. modifies hybrid panel jig)
- Chose tolerance for pre-production of package height of +/-40um
- Suggestion Tony: Aim for 20µm, set 40µm as allowed spec
 - Do measurement both, on jig (required) and on panel (bonus)
