# 13/07/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1054921/
### Introduction
- sfd
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R1 tool production
- R3 tool production
- UK/China module thermal cycling setup
- Production of bonding and testing jigs
- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order
### RFID in Database
- From chat:
 - Run `dmesg -w` when plugging in the reader to explicitely get the port.
 - Also you can edit udev rules to not have to run the chmod every time.
 - Also I useful script for figuring out what /dev files correspond to what device: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/144735
- William: Having to use to press the button to scan the RFID is probably not ideal, especially when handling delicate objects
 - Not clear why this is done, might need some more look into the code
 - Reason: with increased signal strength the reader overheats when running continuously, which is not recommended
 - Increasing the reading time to 10s could already solve this
- William: typing the serial number in is error prone, is there something to do it automatically
 - No way of doing this, might be possible to have a GUI that looks at all components at the institute to allow to pick the correct component; but there is already a question to confirm the component in case of typos or picking wrong components
- Bruce: there is no way directly to interface the RFID with a web browser
 - Karol: depends on where the web app runs (on PC it might work)
- Should all RFIDs use upper case only?
 - All Windows readings so far have shown upper case, use this as convention
### PB Test Coupon and Linpol Qualification
- Ashley: why so large disparity between calculator and measurement?
 - Calculation based on SEM measurement at random location, distance could be different at different places
 - A: should have idea of stack-up from fabrication; for some spacing is different from Adhesive thickness or copper thickness?Measurements from hybrid test coupons does not show this level of difference
- Ashley: thermal cycle profile needs to meet IPC specification from reflow of circuits (1C/sec)
 - Oven canâ€™t do the recommended rate of change
 - A: not sure how important it is to follow this profile
- Ashley: why change in capacitance during heating cycle?
 - Test done at different days and coupon has been resting in dry cabinet
 - A: do you do bakeout before the test?
 - Before cycling coupons are sitting in dry cabinet, but no pre-baking
 - A: polyimide is hygroscopic and absorbs moisture, which could cause blistering during thermal cycling; recommended to do bakeout before test.
### AOB
- nothing
