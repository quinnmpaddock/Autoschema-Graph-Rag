# 07/12/2021 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1084887/
### Introduction
- Hybrid flex components in database now updated for PPB (hybrid arrays, hybrid flex panels)
- Tony: sensor IV qualification is for reception, not post tabbing?
 - Luise: if a tab is attached, it is a module IV

- Irradiated R5 module for December 2021 Testbeam
### End-cap module wire bond numbering proposal
- Forest: question about referencing: do we want to start with bonding signal and data bonds first without referencing the frame first?
 - Bond map is only a reference to identify bonds, not a prescription on how to wire-bond (order of bonds)
- William: will this be a standard everyone has to follow?
 - No, people can bond however they want, this is just a universal mapping
- Luise: it would be good if groups can look into their wire-bond scheme to minimize translation between the wire-bonder and the document. Document could be changed if there is a majority.
- Sergey: will start email discussion about requests
- Barrel: needs to do the same thing, will be done as soon as Sven has time
### LinPol reliability testing
- Luise: TID test of first AMACstar - is there some TID testing from SEU to make the decision or do you need the slow dose rate?
 - Just something to compare with AMACV2a
- Tony: is pre-irradiation sufficient or do you want to do it slow?
 - Craig: depends on the day 0 number
- Ashley: isn’t the peak we pass on to the AMAC under software control?
 - No, it’s internal to the powerboard and therefore requires deciding whether to include the bPol as a backup or not
- Vitaly: for PPB you can change the capacitors; waiting for irradiation would be later then when the powerboards are needed; if you have enough linPOLs loading more boards would be helpful
 - Tony: is it obvious how to translate the failures?
- Ashley: comment: with using the wrong capacitor value, pushed 0 to a higher frequency, probably causes oscillating which then causes failures (need a margin of at least 30% or more, can cause oscillation at the output and kill it)
 - Looked at some, frequency is very low
 - Ashley: surprised, expected high frequency
 - Ash: if you don’t know what the phase margin is, it is difficult to say how valid the measurement is, need the phase margin to see how close we are to stability
- Tony: 1% failure at 80 mA is concerning
- Ashley: do one more board to understand the failure mode
- Craig: if we do an extra board, is there any reason not to do four?
 - Zhicai: no
 - Craig: propose to do four more with correct capacitors and repeat
- Craig: how much detail of this was discussed with Stefano?
 - From Stefano: pointed out that the phase margin was wrong and the high failure rate was not surprising
 - Craig: load with correct capacitors and repeat these tests to see if we see the same failure rate with correct phase margin
- Ashley: one other quick check would be with a thermal imaging camera to look for localized heat in an LDO 
 - Have a thermal camera, but can’t run board without cooling
- Dennis: should also consider that capacitors loose capacitance over time
 - All elements are exactly same parts as in powerboards
 - Dennis: capacitance will age, especially after long time (1000h); should not conclude that with 10u we are fine for the full detector life
- Vitaliy: from Dennis’ description: maybe someone should check the ageing of the 10 uF capacitors
 - Dennis: known process - known degradation for first 1000 hours after soldering
 - Literature about it available, can check
 - Vitaliy: maybe someone should do this, including irradiation, as a dedicated task, if we can
- Vitaliy: sounds like all PPA boards are affected, what do we do about them? Should we be fixing them?
 - Tony: what current are they drawing now? Craig: currently: about 42mA AMACs, much further away from the edge
 - Vitaliy: does it mean we want to live with it
 - Craig: live with it for PPA, so far haven’t seen any of these failures so far
 - Dennis agrees: PPA structures won’t be required to have longevity anyway
- Ashley: wouldn’t be the way forward to go to use the known current and ask them what phase margin we do have and ask them what the phase margin is
 - Vitaliy: wondering if this has implications for the next board
- Vitaliy: proposal to repeat this with corrected capacitors and add data point for 40 mA
- Zhicai: yes, planning to continue and can accommodate - will check if values below 80 mA can be achieved
- Vitaliy: values seem to depend on current - do they also depend on temperature?
 - Zhicai: not sure
 - Vitaliy: might want to include this in questions for CERN: what is the expected temperature dependence of this? Does cooling help?
- Craig: for regulators, is there a target phase margin people should design to?
 - Ash: yes, should be targeting at least 30 degrees or better for stability (quoted values on slides don’t look good)
 - Craig: would be good to find out what the phase margin would be at 40 degrees C with the correct components and compare
-> would be good to have a feeling for how much we would gain by using the correct components
 - Ashley: 20 degrees C and 100mA is probably too close to instability
### SQ feedback discussion
- Question: reduce requirements of 10cm foam for domestic shipping, assuming the 25g indicator is not triggered
 - Ingo: original recommendation came from large amount of shippingIf lose requirements, should at least collect information for an informed decision
 - Luise: different configuration of multi-module shipment box and Peli Case
 - Ingo: should at least collect all the information
 - Tony: is recorded in database
 - Luise: but database does not record packaging information
 - Luise/Ingo: add these as comments to the shipping
- Vitaliy: don’t ship just bare Peli boxes, put them in larger boxes with padding
- Gerrit: should avoid bare Peli cases, so just some packaging is highly recommended; 10cm of foam is not that much, why are 
 - Vitaliy: shipment cost depends on volume
 - Bart: 10cm foam around Peli case exceeds standard box rangeAlready 5cm would make them fit
 - Luise: would put them in a larger box with some packaging
 - Bart: yes
 - Vitaliy: same for US, ship Peli box in larger box
 - Gerrit: modules from Berkely in Peli box, which was in a larger box with peanuts: one of the 25g schock indicators was triggered
 - Bart: had some shipment where indicator on outside of box was triggered, but inside was fine
 - Ingo: past studies have showed that peanuts (even outside) is not good [bad performance]
### AOB
- Tony: receiving sensors, doing tabbing and doing IVs takes timeSuggestion: ship sensors as soon as groups have qualified for HV tabbing, even if they haven’t fully qualified for PPA, to help with timing
- Luise: starting to deliver PPA module components, even if not fully qualified
- Tony: only ship sensors
- Luise: had a discussion
 - When HV-tabbing step is completed and approved (all data uploaded) groups can request to receive part of the sensors
 - Tony: splitting the small volume would not make sense
 - Luise: will need some more time to discuss it first and then communicate the final decision.
### Controlled demolition: Tails from the Crypt [Silicon]
- Postponed to next week
