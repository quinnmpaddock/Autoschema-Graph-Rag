### Barrel powerboard EDMS review
- Change back tolerance of precision holes to group accepted 0.02, redline looser tolerance of 0.05 that would allow LBL to produce these with their preferred vendor that does not commit to 0.02 - make it clear that LBL takes the risk that, if the tools do not fit with others or do not produce modules in spec, the tool has to be redone/reworked
- To be continued offline
### Sensor reception tests
- Picture or no picture for sensors on reception at module site
 - Have to minimise handling steps, so do inspection in prep for IV curve
 - Encourage to take images of found defects
 - Luise prefers to have full image to be able to go back if later defects are found
- Default appears to be that so far we require local pictures of determined issues, not full object
- Have a detailed discussion about this in the module QA/QC meeting on 2020-11-05T15:00:00Z
