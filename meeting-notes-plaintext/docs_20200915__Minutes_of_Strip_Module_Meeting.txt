# 15/09/20 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/927519/
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- EDMS review of tools with bushings to be kicked off imminently
 - Please prioritise ASAP - date will be 1 week from today
- Site quali doc that was circulated: Craig W clarifies this should be a collection of everything that needs to be shown by a site for site qualification. This is anything that has to be shown by any site, so specific sites might not have to show things that do not apply to their promised work. For questions please ask Craig W. Please fill by this Thursday (2020-09-17)
### Task tracker items
- EC tool review -- re-report in 1 week-- EDMS tool review re-started to include bushings.-- Task is 11 days overdue, so dear reviewers, please prioritise this review if at all possible
- R0 tool production -- re-report in 2 weeks-- Due within 47 day(s)
 - Fr will attempt to order bushings for all EC
 - Focussing on getting all drawings finalised (some are still missing)
- R1 tool production -- re-report in 2 weeks-- Due within 47 day(s)-- By Brenner, Richard on 2020-09-14: The manufacturing of production tooling is out for quote with release v. 3.2 drawings. Confirmed that we can do the requested hard anodization. Waiting for the R1 tooling to be approved in EDMS.
- R2 tool production -- re-report in 2 weeks-- Due within 47 day(s)-- same status as at last report:-- workshop has preliminary drawings and is checking them out for planning, aware that smaller changes are expected
- as soon as R2 drawings are updated and through EDMS review, the drawings will be given to the workshop and work should start soon after
- R3 tool production -- re-report in 2 weeks-- Due within 47 day(s)-- same status as last report, receiving parts one by one and checking them for quality to verify potential company
- R4 tool production -- re-report in 2 weeks-- Due within 47 day(s)-- same status as last report
- R5 tool production -- re-report in 2 weeks-- Due within 47 day(s)-- same status as last report
### Hybrid flatness studies (Kaili)
- Very little can be done along edge opposite to ABCs
 - About the only thing you can do is try to bend by hand a bit before assembly
- HCCStar sucking issue has been reported by UCSC before and new toolset does have a larger HCC vacuum hole to try and mitigate this issue
- Various discussions on whether glue seepage etc. is an issue
 - Nothing to say that this degree of seepage is an issue
 - Need to keep an eye on it as we approach higher production volumes
- Hybrid planarity is covered by an industry standard
 - In past did not want to tighten the tolerance due to cost fears
- Should follow-up and see whether such glue seepage is actually an issue
- One worry is that glue pattern has been updated and need to keep an eye on whether this makes the issue any worse
- Watch: first determine if there really is an issue beyond the optical impression. Possible issues:
 - Glue on guard ring
 - Glue mechanically in way of PB
 - Higher noise due to lower HCC
 - S.th. else
 - None of the above have yet been observed
### Barrel hybrid transport box update (Sven)
- Hybrid is helt by tabs only? Is it stable?
 - Was shaken, banged and shipped with no issue
- We have to check tests if vac packing induces issues with material, could it be that N2 flushing is sufficient?
 - Do we even need N2 flushing?
 - We tried and it is very slow, takes hours to dry to required dryness
 - If we find time we could check shipments with desiccant only, no vac no N2 flushing
### First 130 module from Prague Cluster (Martin)
- Module looks good, congrats to first module!
### SEE tests with ABCStar v1 (Luise)
- Moved to ITk week
### Module glue summary (Luise)
- with summary talk technically finalised
- no open questions to industry
- procurement will be done locally to avoid ITk glue shipping. Cluster or smaller groups can get together and order together, local action required.
- Task Status Changed: → Completed
### R2star Testing (Alessia)
- 
- Asd
- Dennis’ Studies on R1Star:
 - First tried dirty hack, by connecting bias ring of sensor to hybrid ground with wirebonds (DC)
 - Gets within 50ish enc of expected noise on uncovered channels
 - Below hybrid still quite high wrt expectation but gets smaller than before as well
 - Changed coupling caps to 220nF (70mΩ@40MHz)
 - Helped compared to previous cap but not as good as dirty hack, still 50ENC worse again
 - Added more direct connection to GND side of cap, didn’t help measurably
 - Shorted DC part to hybrid ground, essentially removing AMAC from chain, didn’t help either
### Testbeam Plans (John & Jiri)
- We will focus on large scale items >module (aka petal) now
- Then build irrad module with current neutron sensors and final ASICs, possibly TID-ed at Karol’s new XRay machine, or at RAL
### AOB
- None
