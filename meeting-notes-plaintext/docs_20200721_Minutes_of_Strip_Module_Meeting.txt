# 21/07/20 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/927511/
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- Endcap hybrids now on EDMS, review will be kicked off soon
- Endcap power boards need to get checked as well, Craig/Ingo will send out reminder mails
- Barrel power board was reviewed, need to confirm that most up to date version is the one that got reviewed
- Barrel hybrids got reviewed, no further detailed review expected
- Tool drawings for both endcap and barrel are being updated and will get reviewed soon
### Schedule summary (Craig)
- Coarse schedule:
 - Prototyping now until October 20
 - Pre-prod A October 20 - Feb 21 (including site quali)
 - Note that during pre-production, all QC steps need to be performed (minus agreed upon steps limited by setup availability: hybrid burn-in, module thermal cycling and powerboard reception tests)
 - Pre-prod B Feb 21 - Sept 21
 - PRR Sept 21
 - Production Apr 22 - Aug 25
- Do we need final DAQ for systems FDR?
 - Not sure, testing the hardware rather than firmware, so having final DAQ might not be necessary → to be checked 
- Assuming that HCCstar and AMACstar available by February, isn’t that too optimistic?
 - From latest exercise, delay about 1 month compared to current schedule (could be 2 months)
 - Hard to judge with current uncertainties, might be optimistic, but should still try to stay on current path 
- What are we doing between end of pre-production and start of production? Risk of loosing expertise during those 6 months?
 - Break extended to this long duration due to delays (used to be ~3 months)
 - Might be that building last pre-production parts extends into this break
- Priming factor for ABCs is mainly getting SEE tests done
- When do 4 staves for integration tests have to be available at CERN?
 - Modules build up until July 21, loading after that, delivery to CERN ~end of July
- Is it envisions that the remainder of pre-production (12 staves) can be smeared out in the time until production?
 - Potentially yes. But system tests items have to be ready in time for the system test FDR
 - After that no hard schedule reason to push through the remaining staves fast
### Suction cups (Jane)
- Current suction cups are sittings on modules without problems seen, not huge sample size but it’s what we have
 - Modules handled with silicon suction cups have been irradiated and tested but not in huge numbers
 - A full test of sensors with residue is a massive undertaking
- Cups not being anti-static should not be an issue (have never seen one)
- Should be followed up offline
 - Craig has contacted company to understand process by which suction cups are made anti-static
- Would it be possible to irradiate test piece with a lot of visible residue?
 - Technically yes but would involve significant amount of work
 - If we want to do this we need to find manpower
### Cicorel cards (Simon)
- Gerrit got much cheaper prices than UK, where does difference come from?
 - Could be due to limited availability 
- Should not be limited availability since they usually come with the bonders they sell for testing, maybe there’s a new design now?
 - Not that Simon knows about, should check
- Gerrit waits for response from Hesse US 
- Rectangular design preferred? Not clear
- Should ensure that cards we get are actually optimised for pull testing, not for setting up bonder programs
- Do we want to make a bulk purchase? → wait for US quote first
### AoB
- 130 barrel paper was accepted WITHOUT COMMENTS!!! Party time!
