# 2025-02-11 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1513177/
### Introduction
Presenter: Navid Ghorbanian
No questions
### L4 Updates
#### Topic: Module Production Coordination
Presenter: Abe
- Andy: Do we have to think about the storage?
 - Abe: I don’t have an answer for you 
- Jaya John: When we ship big fractions/high value, we invest 20 CHF in an AirTag tracker so we can say where the parcel is 
 - Navid: I think that sounds like a good idea, who would buy these trackers, would that be you Jaya John?
 - Jaya John: Perhaps it’s up to the supplier sites, and receivers send the tags back.
 - Navid: So whoever is distributing would be responsible for getting trackers
 - Vitaliy: Good question and maybe Jaya John’s proposal can help. In terms of pure storage, all sites in production should have passed their site qualification steps, so in principle storage is ready. Thinking out loud, this is also why checking on available components before sending more is worthwhile. I suspect it’s more likely that people will misplace and forget about components compared to anything else 
 - Comment from Jaya John in the chat: While items are in transit from CERN, they are fully insured. However while on site at CERN they are only insured if the value goes over 3M CHF… So where we have big accumulations at sites, may need some thoughts
- Sven: Do I also have to buy an iphone now?
 - Navid: Buy whatever trackers you want, Sven. 
- Jaya John Via chat: While items are in transit from CERN, they are fully insured. However while on site at CERN, they are only insured if the value goes over 3M CHF… So where we have big accumulations at sites, may need some thoughts.
#### Topic: Correlation of early breakdown on sensor and module level
Presenter: Christoph
- Navid: That sounds like a good thing to do, good to get things in the database and understand these things
 - Christoph: Good idea and time to get module database cleaned up 
- Navid: it is one of the recommendations from the rFDR that we should understand these early breakdowns
 - Christoph: We have a lot of sensor data already so if we can get the data from the module side, then we can make a nice investigation of the correlations 
### Group Update: Valencia
Presenter: Carles
- Vitaly: On slide 6 you mention some kind of offset, sorry I missed it, measuring humidity?
 - Carles: yes prevents you to start the thermal cycles, relative humidity you can read, up to now we were just putting new sensors in cold box when they developed this offset
 - Vitaly: which sensors were these?
 - Carles: 969 I think 
 - Vitaly: deionisation studies, when you test a module you have foam cover on top, is the right? To deionise you remove the cover and then after put it back?
 - Carles: Yes
 - Vitaly: Worried the cover may produce some of these effects, can you test without the cover?
 - Carles: We can definitely test warm without the cover, with the coldbox flushed with dry air. We can measure the ESD voltage on the pink foam 
 - Vitaliy: I would be interested if you can do that! 
- Ben: We have tried deionizer 6 months ago, it sprayed a fine mist of oil over the sensor, obviously noticed electrically and could see droplets with a microscope, non-evaporating liquid. Are you planning on using a fan or emitter and compressed air?
 - Carles: We are using the ion gun recommended by Prague, it’s not really cheap
 - The one we are considering using is this, slide(4)
 - Ben: Do be careful because that looks similar to the one we had problems with, will look like a fan but may be worth blowing it onto glass for half an hour then inspecting the glass.
 - Carles: will do
- Gerrit by chat: Bad idea to use an old freezer. There is a reason why they are smelly, i.e. outgassing.
 - Carles: it's not smelly and it's <4 y.o.
### Thicker Than Expected SE4445 in Interposed Hybrids
Presenter: Karol
- Michael: We also see sticky gel packs, pick and place machine can’t always pick the ASICs out ~5% of the time maybe a little bit less, Santa Cruz picks them out for us, you’re not going crazy
 - Tony: Kirsten can show you how we do it, we hold it under vacuum for about 5 mins to 30 mins
 - Kirstin: 5 mins - half an hours
 - Karol: We had that similar issue and followed similar advice from Liverpool but some gel paks are just too bent for that! 
 - Gerrit: just put a thicker O-ring in, gel packs come in different variety, depending on what you put them in. Recommendation is to throw them out to get them out od the pool
- Tony: in this particular case it’s not diff stickiness levels, they over did the vacuum seal, that’s the understanding Jaya John sent us
 - Gerrit: Overdid the vacuum? 
 - Vitaly: the base plate is bent
 - Gerrit: we’ve been doing this for years, it happens once in a while. The gel packs are different. You can release the vacuum 10 times or so sometimes that helps	
 - Jaya John: An unfortunate thing that in the early days of sealing, we thought “if a little vacuum is a good thing, then a lot of vacuum must be a great thing” and that wasn’t true. For sites that are mostly automated, we’ll try to send well-behaved gel paks. At Celestica, time is money – we’ll send gel paks from later in production. Earlier packed gel paks we’ll try to send to Barrel sites that can try tricks like thicker O-rings. We’ve just mailed some bent gel paks to Geoffrey at Uppsala to see how much warping NOTE can handle 
 - Gerrit: If you have warped ones we’re happy to take them, just put a sticker on there
 - Vitaly: its not trivial, they are significantly warped
 - Gerrit: I have dealt with this so many times already, just send them, we’ll fix it, we just need to know which ones they are
 - Jaya John: They are visually obvious
Presenter: Sven
- Navid: Do we use the hybrids that have lower ASIC glue heights, which in theory means we loosen the spec on the glue heights, what do people think about that?
 - Tony A: The question is – is this what we’ll get forever, or will something change to get the thickness we want?
 - Navid: We can reduce the thickness of the shim, tests at RAL it does bring average thickness down. 110um for interposer layer, can reduce shim by 10um to bring down to 100um. If it’s not a problem I think we don’t do that, we’ll be reducing the layer and we don't know how that might affect cracking
 - Tony A: Right. Then why is the expected thickness this? The flex is thicker on average? 
 - Navid: Flex is thicker, adding interposer layer that is thicker than 110um, 110um is the average some have thicker layers
 - Tony: 110 versus 100 isn’t driving this, right? 
 - Navid: yes 
 - Tony: UK and US tools are slightly different. We have to check. We were worried about the UV cure not being sufficient, so that’s why we set the lower bound 
 - Navid: how do we measure the UV cure not being sufficient? We can’t bond it?
 - Tony: Hard to tell, we made a guess on the thickness, can’t remember what the lower end tolerance is allowed
 - Gerrit: Let’s not open this can of worms about UV curing again. We’ve been through it so many times. It’s too much to do deal with all over again 
 - Navid: We have added this interposer layer so we have a bigger varying thickness of hybrids so we probably shouldn’t just ignore as might be throwing away hybrids that are good
 - Tony A: You could see in data collected – is it collected? Are all the ones failing on the high end? I don’t think that the interposed material was really changing the width distribution based on the collected measurements 
 - Navid: Before it’s +/- 40 the hybrids by themselves
 - Tony A: That’s what I’m saying - the width on this curve (S4) isn’t any different 
 - Sven: At the moment we have interposed flexes from two diff manufacturing batches, variations between the flexes which widens the curve. Less than 10um within a batch but if you consider batches together it widens it	
 - Tony A: yes, sure, but my statement is that the interposers aren’t drivers on the width. It’s the hybrid thickness variation. We’re not centered on the right point. I think the tools are crooked on the stack up 
 - Navid: going back to the specific question from Birmingham, what do we do with these hybrids, can we build modules with them? 
 - Tony: that’s the reason we had the tolerance setup so we could get the UV cure
 - Ingo: Isn’t this driven by interposing rather than UV curing? 
 - Tony: No you’re asking for the acceptable thickness of glue under the chip, set by if you can UV cure it or not. Some of the chips are at 40, do you have confidence that the UV cure is going to be ok? I wouldn’t 
 - Gerrit: I wouldn’t, I refuse, below 60um it’s a mess, sometimes it cures sometimes it doesn’t. Already have to shim up LEDs now we have interposers
 - Navid: Answer is then that we won’t use these hybrids 
 - Karol: why do we care if the UV cures, will cure when irradiated, short term can bond the thing
 - Gerrit: I will refuse to do this. We’ve had issues with UV curved glue not cured properly. They get sticky and we cannot bond them. That they’ll be cured in 10 years time in ATLAS is irrelevant 
 - Karol: so we just take the hit on the yield?
 - Silence
 - Tony: Correct, the total stack up of the hybrids is within the =/- 40 of the target. If failing on the tail, that’s the situation. Solution would be to do adjustment so tools are closer to centre which would be a shim different from standard shim, would be the same for the glue. You have the problem on the edge because the tool is giving you a tilt. Is that 40um low, the red point on slide 4.
 - Karol: the blue is the line
 - Tony: 20um low on average so failing, 20um out from lowest cut, kind of consistent
 - Karol: even then with the side that is better we are kind of on the edge, I agree it’s not as bad because we have tilted tools. 
 - Tony A: I know, but if you keep making these parts - either we have to know the stability of what you’re getting – and keep measuring their part thicknesses (which no one wants to do!) – or fix the mean of the distribution or take the hit in the yield. You could knock the chips off if the UV cure isn’t there, so I wouldn’t risk it
 - Karol:	
- Navid: So these hybrids should not be used for modules and they will be a yield loss, everyone happy with that?
- Karol: Yes we can also adjust the shims
- Vitaliy: I was also wondering if in the future I could adjust the shims? Thickness variation we knew in principle could happen - some variation before interposing,, more than we were expecting now. If most of the diff comes from interposer kapton thickness, could we have better controlled thickness for the future?
 - Navid: We can make the layer thinner, but in terms of control - we can do 10 std from my memory 
 - Vitaliy: +/-10 would be ok, sounds like you have a larger diff here
 - Tony: driven by hybrid thickness rather than kapton
- Navid: yes driven by hybrid thickness +/-40um
- Karol: Tony was asking how the thickness compares 
with previous, and it’s very similar 
### Cold Noise: Is Your Glue Sticking Through Thick or Thin, or Is It Pulling Up Stakes?
Presenter: Yoshi
- No questions
- Navid: thanks for carrying out these studies, good to see there is no cold noise, no closer to understanding the cause?
- Vitaly: at least we’re not worse in understanding
- Navid: yes
### ASIC assembly concerns 
Presenter: Geoffrey
- Gerrit in chat: Use polarizing filter on microscope? Scratches and imperfections are usually more apparent with a polarizing filter. Scratches and imperfections are usually more apparent with a polarizing filter
- Ingo in the chat: think of ESD when adding rubber/plastic
- Vitaly: I don’t think scratches are fine, the kapton on top of the chips is 4um deep, its easy to scratch and not too difficult to damage. We have had this in the US at BNL. We traced this back to the pick up tool, it is a problem with aluminum when you drill a hole it bulges. The bulges can be only a few microns but they weren't noticed, we had to chisel these out. We don't like these scratches, we do not know when these problems come up. It boils down to the pick up tool
 - Geoffrey: Unclear what the tool is made of I need to check, one of the things we were thinking is one of the guys on GE said there was a way to make a small cushion, we could put a piece of rubber that is workable when its cold then put it on top of the tool. Or we could do optical grade sanding of the surface to flatten it.
 - There are probably several ways to skin this cat. Thanks very much for the detailed report if other people see scratches they should raise this too.
- Ben: In Celestica we saw the same thing, we tried to change things with the tools but nothing worked. We then got the tools anodised and this created a rim around each hole, I cleared this with a shart drill bit. We fixed this by looking at the ASIC pick up tool and the ATLAS pick up tool
- Geoff: We don't have ATLAS tools so it can only be the pick up tool
- Ingo by chat: think of ESD when adding rubber/plastic
- Jaya John: I agree with Vitaly we need to avoid these scratches
- Gerrit: The problem is not so much burrs, our pick up tools had really sharp needles that you couldn't even see under a really high mag microscope. We only saw this because we had circular marks on the chips. It needs to be fixed. The problem with our pick up tools is you cannot sand them because we rely on the height. With your tool this might not be an issue because you are using a pick and place
- Geoff: Yes then the problem will be leveling. The other option is to buy a couple extra. They are about 1k dollars each. It's good to hear that it can be alleviated.
