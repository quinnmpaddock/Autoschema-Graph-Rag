# 2025-04-29 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1527309/
### Introduction
Presenter: Cole
- Tony: Suggest group meetings be more full-cluster and rotate every 6 weeks
### L4 Updates
#### Production
Presenter: Abe
- No questions, all clear
### Mini Group Update: Montreal
Presenter: Nghia
- William: For the missing VDD bond, we have no ability to fix that at Celestica. I can’t see them returning there. We see this quite a lot when we ship modules. It’s likely something that needs to be fixed at the module assembly site, so please don’t send them back to us.
- William: I’m not sure how it passed the electrical tests
- Nghia: We don’t do electrical tests when we see these problems of missing bonds.
 - William: You should try that testing them
- William: We can’t afford to replace a few bonds.
- [need help with notes]
- Luise: We would have to pull the wires near it anyways. But we assume that these are now one of those small defects that we have to accept. Nghia, I think it would be helpful that people get a note that explains this so those who want to repair can and know.
 - Nghia: So far we haven’t sent these out, but if any of the hybrids whose broken bonds detected… we will make sure to label it on the ESD bag so module sites will be aware[missed it]
 - Cole: this is what triggered the question you can tell there is something causing an issue with the cycling 
 - Nghia: you are seeing the decline
 - William: even with the difference in gain it is still a pass but this means that the 3 other hybrids on the panel will be fails
 - Cole: the big jumps I am not concerned about they look like misreads
 - William: relaxing it to an acceptable hour, it seems that it has relaxed over time, you sideline 4 hybrids if you reject stuff like this 
 - Cole: I don’t think we should put this to one side it would be good to continue with it see what happens to in once on a module
 - William: we should figure out what to do with things like this at ITk week
### Noise Peaks on R2 Modules
Presenter: Archa Rajagopalan
- Cole: For the split modules, the peak character seems different.Have you taken this in for hot pix imagining
 - Archa: We haven't yet
- Carles: Something we’ve realized about ESD is that the glue in the mixing containers can generate tens of kV. We are trying to deionize the jar before we use the glue. If you have a fan, perhaps you can get rid of it. And maybe use and ESD meter to measure.
 - Archa: We don't use a thinky mixer here, it would be good to see if the trays we are mixing the glue in have any trapped charge
 - Carles: This is the only thing
- Marta:: we don't have that much experience with the R2s and haven't seen those peaks, do you see those peaks when you go to low temperatures?
 - Archa: I believe so. I don’t do TC here, so I don’t have the results specifically.
 - Cole: I'm not sure if we cycled these fully yet so not sure if TC affects it.
- Luise: One thing we were planning on next was to look at the S-curves to see if this is noise or weird injected signal. Also, Hamburg has shown modules like this in the past and we assumed these peaks would go away over time. We are curious if any of them persisted like this?
 - Christian: we had indeed, we checked if it coincided with the pick up tools but we got rid of all the peaks through deionising 
 - Luise: If you could check, that would be really helpful
- Abe: Just to confirm, this is for an R2 perseries module?
 - Archa: yes
- Vitaliy: Just to check, when you use the deionizer, did you remove the pink covers?
 - Archa: Yes and the foam.
 - Vitaliy: thank you 
- Vitaly: I guess you could try UV light in principle as well. 
 - Archa: We can look into that
 - Vitaliy: As I recall this was developed by Andrew to be applicable to both modules and sensors
 - Luise: It’s at TRIUMF Archa
### Reproducing Pinholes Made by Bonding
Presenter: Tate Sakaguchi
- Cole: is there anything you can recommend definitely to reduce this from happening
 - Forest: I love thumbs. I don’t know if there is a way to both mitigate the change of a pinhole vs giving a high-quality weld. It would be difficult to tease out a number. Our parameters would weld show the deformation curve rolling over in the 15-25 ms range. The idea would be to reduce the time duration to roughly that time frame, but that does limit the chance to weld wires that would otherwise not bond due to friction. In bonding, it’s more reliable to terminate on deformation rather than time alone. It used to be done with time alone, now it’s deformation. Overall, you might sacrifice some wires that don’t weld as well as others. However, if you lose a lot of wires, you create a lot of pinholes. Easy answer is: make good wires.
 - Vitaliy: is there a way to catch lost wires so one doesn’t bond with a bare wedge?
 - Forest: Ideally the machine would stop if it had no wire on the source, however if it thinks it has a good weld on the source it will try to bond the destination. What can happen is the first weld is not good but not bad enough for the machine to notice its not and it goes onto the destination and fails there scrubbing into the sensor pad
 - Tony: I don’t think we saw this locally though. I don’t recall us making multiple bonds, it usually stops on the first weld.
 - Forest: If we have a really bad case on the first bond, we will stop. But it has to be a very bad case, so our typical failure is we try to do the first one, if there is a stub of wire sticking out, it welds that to the second bad. This can be problematic, but we don’t try again anymore.
 - Tony: one thing you could do for a rebond. You should only do them if you have to.
 - Gerrit: I thought we decided not to rebond. There are certain specs to allow us to miss wires.
 - Tony: I don't disagree, if you have to rebond, we don't miss enough wires to justify rewiring and dont re-bond onto a toolmark
 - Kirsten: Rebonding isn’t the thing that causes the pin hole, it’s the empty wedge grinding on the pad in the first place, which can be unavoidable. But you can adjust the machine so it doesn’t do it several times in a row.
 - Gerrit: that's only if your using PIQC not everyone is doing that
 - Forest: maybe other people are doing something differently. The machine should not continue if there is not enough welding. If we are missing a wire it stops on either machine no problem. I don't think we should rebond onto a toolmark
 - Cole: there is no rule of thumb as there is no rule of thumb
 - Forest: having a sufficient tail on your source bond will make a huge difference. A lot of the missed source bonds could be solved by having a sufficient tail. 
 - Gerrit: I didn't want to make that statement for exactly that reason. This is what was causing most of the issues 
- William: We don’t test every strip before we make modules. Are most pinholes from assembly problems?
 - Vitaliy: they are built in pinholes and they are very rare, the spec is 1%. You can scratch it but this will also have other issues, seen in the back of the presentation 
 - William: Okay.
 - Christoph: From our experience, strip tests. Pin holes are the rarest kind of defect we see. It’s usually the Rbias that make up the majority of the problem. 
### Update: Barrel Single-Interposed Powerboards
Presenter: Len
- Peter: When you say you adjusted the tools you mean the pins on the PB?
 - Len: Forest adjusted the tools. We used a 50um shim to bring up a PB and then reset the pins to that height. So each tool was adjusted accordingly
 - Peter: thanks
- Tony: The whole point was to start redistributing the rest of them. The only concern would be if your current tooling gets you to 140um thickness but as far as I know this is what people are targeting
 - Cole: does anyone have any issues with this
- William: We’ve struggled with this in the EC. So I’m not quite sure “seems mostly alright”.
 - Tony: what we are saying within these measurements the average is to within 20um. The spec is +-40 in this glue so we should be okay with passing those parts. 
 - William: take the average instead of every one of them. 
 - Tony: That's the spec we always do on the average. The only one to be concerned is the point by the guard ring. If anything this point tends to be high. And the lowest point by the HV mux. For what we are doing in the barrel this is pretty failsafe. 
 - William: I don’t disagree. At P1 it’s about a cm long. We’ll come up with an empirical answer eventually.
 - Tony: I think its okay
 - A
- Bart: I guess I agree. The end of the PB is a good feature. From these measurements it looks good and it’s hard to say how it will work in practice due to how the PB is constrained. If you ask me definitively if it’s okay … we’ll I’d have to see it.
 - Tony: The goal would be to ship these in groups of six, then you can look at it. Mix them in slowly until you have confidence with them 
 - Bart: It’s just that we are in the process of setting the pins on the production tools, so we are selecting the “most average” one and hoping these aren’t too far off.
 - Tony: The statement that we see is they are flatter and they seem to be thinner. It is really a question of if the settings of your pins sets it above 140 um. I would be most concerned about the setting it
 - Bart: Yeah, it would be a bit of wasted effort to set them now and again in a few weeks.
 - Tony: It shouldn’t be. The metrology wasn’t adjusted for the thickness. As long as you get 120 um thickness on average, these will just go in.
 - Tony: we will distribute them
### AOB
- Nope
