# 14/09/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1054931/
### Introduction
- compile list of current component types and their children that should be used
- rename old types outdated to avoid confusion
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- [see task tracker]
### 
### HV tabs: Visual inspection vs. test results at TRIUMF/SFU
- Is there some definition of good?
 - >200g on cicorel card, >300g on half moon
- Forest: would fail all of them on visual inspection
 - Tony W. wanted to compare VI with tab sheering to see if there is a correlation
 - Forest: it is imperative to have perfectly good looking tabs for the single-point failure object
 - William: have some issues with tabs even though process was optimized in the pastWhat are the plans to replace the tabs?
 - Bart: Oxford is optimizing process to get better quality tabs
- Richard: where did the specifications come from?
 - Kirsten: from trial and error
 - Richard: would question this
 - Forest: main driver is to approach the tensile strength of the tab; 
 - Kirsten: tensile strength 480g
 - William: is 150g enough? Maybe have to investigate what the minimum is (also if tabs will have wiggles)
 - Forest: if these tabs is what we get, need to start looking into the wiggles
 - Bonds on half-moons need to be superior to cicorel card, so if bonds on real object fail it’s on the stave not under the sensor
- Tony W. is waiting for feedback before making new tabs; anyone who did tests should provide results to Tony W.
 - Would be good to gather the results and compile them before sending them to Tony W.
- Richard: what is seen here is probably not a normal oxide layer but rather some form of contamination
- Need a meeting to collect results
 - Also need something from EC, but needs more time
 - Can try to organize a meeting to give Tony some feedback so he can produce more tabs; maybe next week
### Strip Module IV
- When are merge requests to be processed?
 - Slow going: comparison gui is merged, others need more time (in contact with Bruce)
- Are you planning to make a tutorial on how to use everything?
 - Jupyter notebook tutorial is part of merge request
### EC Hybrid/Powerboard Procurement Status
- William: are the hybrids they are handling from Wurth?
 - Uli: yes, the design is not final but some changes might not be as drastic as you wish for
 - William: Is there a possibility to have the hybrid removal more similar to barrel?
 - Dennis: it's a more high risk change, can talk with Wurth about it but will probably not change
 - William: struggling with current design and have to see
 - Uli: this technical change is risky and will probably not happen
- Tony: What needs to be approved?
 - Uli: pads for HCC and decoupling capacitors
- Tony: what is the plan if SMD tender is not ready when the hybrids arrive?
 - Would probably circumvent tender to get first parts populated
 - First 1-2 hybrids will be hand stuffed to build modules and test the design (also at 640MBit)
- Luise: will there be crossed wirebonds around HCC?
 - Dennis: for ABCV0 there was a flip and there is a hook in the trace so that no crossing bonds are requiredThis hoock will be dropped for PPB and production with the new chip design
### Discussion - Storing sensors for modules
- Tony: big issue is sites that don’t have probe stations
- Luise: for option 2, how low would the percentage need to be to do this?
 - Bart: Hamamatsu warranty stretches for 10 months (?) so something could be doneDon’t see issue putting sensors back in envelope after test
 - Luise: mainly handling, and would need another IV if module is assembled >3months later
 - Bart: for UK use already custom carriers, so no additional handling, for sites with probe station is already a lot of handlingWouldn’t cut on number of tests
 - Jonas: disagrees since wire-bonding and removing is a delicate process and they don’t have enough framesWould skip reception IV as long as there is a storage issue and only test when shipping
 - Gerrit: agrees with Jonas;
 - Tony: want to show that shipment causes damage through reception test (Luise agrees)
 - Luise/Tony: would probably still have to do visual inspection to make sure sensors are not physically damaged
 - Luise: IV would find humidity issues; maybe only do it when humidity logger is triggered
 - Tony: need to open up every envelope?
 - Bart: probably only if outer package is damaged
 - Gerrit: never seen sensor that is broken in shipment from HPK
 - Phil: only have seen debry in packaging from dicing, that could damage sensors
 - But would show up at sensor testing sites already
- Tony: do we have to check at least the first shipment from a site to make sure everything is fine?
 - Gerrit: do it during pre-production
 - Tony: do full reception testing for PPA/PPB sensorsThen from this experience can scale down on IV/Visual Inspection for production sensors
 - Luise: makes sense to collect data during pre-production and then look how much testing is requiredWould at least test 1 sensor per delivery
- Plan: do all test for PPB; store everything in envelopes for storage planning
- Gerrit: for pre-production will do testing on test frames, do we have to put them back in envelopes for pre-production?
 - Tony: keep them on frames; receive them as you would do for modules (reception test, tabbing, re-test)
 - Luise: up to sites! Comment above true for US, but people might prefer to store sensors in envelopes and of course they can
