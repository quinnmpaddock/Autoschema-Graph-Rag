# 01/09/20 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/927517/
## Minutes
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- Electrical R2 (to cross check EC Star module noise issues) is glued, transported to Zeuthen and currently being bonded up
- Meeting with BPol team last Friday, they think they found reason for the observed failures. V6 with fix should arrive in March 2021. They are now confident that operating voltage can stay at 11V :). We can do transition reliability tests in March. We did not see schematics so fix is somewhat vague so far. 
### Task tracker items
- EC tool review-- currently on the powerboard tooling (see below). Upload to EDSM should be on Thursday. Re-report in 1 or 2 weeks
- US hybrid/module tool production-- delayed@LBL, asked to move report to next week
 - Prelim quote is missing an item, but is good else, Drawing is nearly ready, worked through weekend to get them ready. Testing of tools was delayed this is where the a
- UK/China hybrid/module tool production-- Tools expected to be delivered to RAL between 11th and 18th September 2020. After arrival they will be shopped to Liverpool for metrology/QC
- UK/China powerboard tool production-- drawings done last week, so get quotes this week. Re-report in 2 weeks
- US powerboard tool production-- delayed@LBL, asked to move report to next week
- Barrel powerboard tool review-- All comments (by Sven in EDMS) were taken into account and responses presented by Todd Claybaugh's (module meeting August 25th). Drawings were updated and Accepted by Sven (All issues from the previous review have been addressed), accepted with Warning by Nigel (missing drawing AU-1012-5580) , Accepted by Masahiro with clarification to Nigel comment (AU-1012-5580 is identical to NP49-02-329, which appears in the Barrel Tools AT2-IS-DF-0003)https://edms.cern.ch/document/2067876/2.2
 - Check with Craig to close review
- Barrel hybrid/module tool review-- Tools reviewed by Masahiro Morii (accepted and no errors found) and Timon Heim (seen, but can't review).
 - Review finished due today, check with Craig if we can close. 
 - Check with Craig to close review, Sven and Masahiro are positive we can close
- EC hybrid review-- First round of EDMS review is completed. Suggested changes were implemented.The 2nd round of EDMS review should finish soon. Re-report in a week or two
- Powerboard review (EC)-- rather a lot was changed (outer shape, positions of larger items on top)
 - Tools have to be adjusted, done up to R5 and no collisions found. 
- EC PPA/prototype hybrid order-- Designs largely ready for Pre-Prod/PPA. Mainly waiting for Bus-Tape related requests for design changes from Fernando/Pepe. Expect to send orders to WE and db-electronic by the end of next week. Further EC PB/hyb tendering: Status of Market Survey: 13 companies replied on time. All of the responses are missing information and need to be clarified by asking dedicated questions to the companies. These questions should be compiled and sent by the end of week 37. Re-report next week
- EDMS finalise docs: Procedures/QC etc-- see slides on agenda
 - push back deadline to 9.9.2020
 - Those that contain relevant info for DB development please do try for finish in coming days
 - Changes in google documents from focus group to initial author highlighted in different text colour => keep this for EDMS review?
- Shipping tracing, actual shipping, transport boxes (module list)-- see: https://cern.ch//atlas-itk-scripts/scripts/tasktracker?modcc=1&ccid=211&tpg=16
 - Re-report in 2 weeks
- DB readiness / doc
 - Coordinate with Craig and Andy to ask all QC task groups to check Andy’s overview document that all tests are included
- Adhesives tech. finalisation, procurement-- Luise and Vitaliy have prepared slides which are being finalised and will be shown next week. Presentation of slides in 2 weeks
### Tools in the database
- Metrology files should be classified as “RAW DATA” so that upload and re-downloaded files are identical
 - We will then not have to use a common format
 - We should have a description of what is in the file together with the upload?
- All barrel tools have a comment in drawing to have to have serial numbers, but EC does not. So it is a nice to have not a must. RFid however is a MUST. The tests in the DB are optional. The first metrology test however is required before first time use. 
- Todo for Ash: please upload PCB for RFID tags to EDMS so that US and endcap sites can look into making them
### Cleanroom requirement discussion
- Sensor rel hum is now less than 10% and modules should also adhere to this
 - Could take too much time in which case you would have to define a mitigation strategy (e.g. lower V_bias ?)
- Agreement: module sites testing sensors should treat them the same as sensors at sensor QC sites (temperature and humidity requirements during testing, measurement resolution of humidity and temperature can be relaxed), requirements can be loosened after sensors are assembled into modules
- Room RH: 40+/-20%, and if not able to achieve a mitigation strategy need to be in place
- Agree on ESD requirements (as the ideal to strive for, with mitigation strategies if requirements can’t be met)
- Room T: NN+/-1C, temperature should be stable over a day; for higher fluctuations a mitigation strategy needs to be in place (e.g. prove that it does not affect systems)
 - Test system temperature stability should be +/-1C (if room temperature fluctuates more, a thermally isolated module test system should be used / metrology systems need to be temperature corrected, ...)
- ISO 6 vs ISO 7: in ISO 7 environment, try to follow e.g. gowning regime or ISO 6
 - Strive to be better than ISO 7
 - Need to make sure to control everything that is taken into the cleanroom (equipment, paper, …)
### AOB
- none
