# 16/08/2022 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1154793/
### Introduction
- Carles: how should confirm that have a FMC-DP:
 - Luise: Send an email
### Summary of cold noise discussion
- Vitaliy: comment to waveforms: can the scope to a fourier transformation?
 - Ashley: yes, but currently don’t have access to cleanroom
 - Vitaliy: and data saved were just screenshots?
 - Ashley: yes
- Everything comes to a screeching halt when the Liverpool cleanroom isn’t accessible.
- Gerrit: is there any way to actually affect the rise and fall times of the Buck converter? Is there any control over it?
 - Ashley: believe it is set by the chip itself (MOSFET inside of chip)
 - Ash: might be something we can do, leave it with Ash - there may be something we can do about it
### Task tracker items

- R1 tool production
 - Geoffrey: contact Uppsala if you need your R1 tools, they are ready now
 - Luise: only if they want their first set replaced or if they want the full production quantity?
 - Geoffrey: should be full quantity, but please get in touch
 - Carles: do you need the tools that were first sent out back?
 - Geoffrey: needs to be discussed on an individual basis
 - Sven: please send an e-mail to the list
- Endcap module thermal cycling setup
 - No news
- Modules for Test Beam
 - TRIUMF: R2 module glued, to be bonded today
 - Cambridge: SS module is being assembled
 - Regarding other modules: 
 - R1 was built, analysis ongoing,
 - R3 and R4: planned for end of November, need to pay attention to make sure they are assembled on time given powerboard re-design, sensors are irradiated and in hand, now waiting for powerboards
- Glue Studies
 - Dedicated talk today
 - Waiting for polaris+ for the lab joint test, but started with other glues
 - Chemical analysis shows chlorine in all glue samples (5% in polaris, 2-3% in other glues)
### Institute Contributions
- 
Next week: 
### Update on glue studies: sensor tests
- Vitaly: what is the thermal cycling?
 - Luise: we are going to do the same thermal cycling that we did for previous glues: -30 to +40 in same rate as before and also look at accelerated temperature change
 - Luise: do rapid changes to see if that causes stress, also stay at high temperature (40C) to look for longterm effects
 - Vitaliy: are you irradiating with gammas?
 - Luise: yes, only irradiate with gammas so no annealing
 - Vitaliy: do you measure strip capacitance, since this affects strip noise?
 - Jack: plot shows all the measurements we take
 - Vitlaliy: this is not the strip capacitance, it is the coupling capacitance. They have different effects on the noise
 - Jack: can figure out how to do this.
