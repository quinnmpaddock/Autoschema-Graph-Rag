## Actions carried over
None
## Minutes
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- Upgrade week still happening remotely
 - Sensors/ASICs/modules will be on the Wednesday
### EC tooling update (Marc)
- EC sites, please check the number of tools (at least R0!!) are correct so production things can start happening
 - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QdbWKPLVTP1uK6mV2fKNJh7lo0UFF-Fhqb8GB_p4pVY/edit#gid=0
- Freiburg to do QC on all the tools?
 - Useful to do centrally but risks lots of shipping
 - Going through one setup gets better consistency
 - Some fabrication companies can provide CMM measurements anyway
 - Inspection QC drawings could (should?) be made in similar way to the barrel
 - For now, decision to baseline with tool QC being done at institutes local to the manufacture
### DAQ boards and chip availability (Craig)
- FMC-IB - Dortmund (Felix) volunteered
- Single panel adapter (Ingo to find out if DESY-Z can do it)
- People agree with the chip distribution suggested in slides:
 - Note, AMAC 50:50 LBL:Freiburg
 - HCC distribution to match ABC with excess held somewhere central for preproduction A
### Storage humidity discussion (Karola)
- Short discussion, result of which is that we change specification to 10% for all components
 - Ingo happy, as long as we do not move above 10%!!
### Clean room environmental conditions monitor system (Vicente)
- Request to add details to Luise’s twiki
 - https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/Atlas/StripUpgradeCleanroom
- Can any common software be done for all these options?
### Database tutorial part 4: shipping (Luise)
- Everyone asked to ship something through the database as a test
### AoB
- None
