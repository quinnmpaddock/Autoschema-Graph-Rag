# 23/03/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1008267/ 
### Introduction
- Site qualification for cleanroom standards can now begin
 - Info on how to quali on the item is attached to agena and also included in email to arrive soon
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R0 tool production
 - First set of tools assembled
 - Waiting for missing order of bushings
 - Marc gone next 2 weeks
- R1 tool production
 - No news currently, will give update in 3 weeks
- R2 tool production
 - In workshop, some parts of tools came back, more info in 2 weeks
- EC hybrids/powerboard tendering
 - Progressing every week with weekly meetings on procurement
 - Hope to be done in 6 weeks with doc ready
- UK/China module thermal cycling setup
 - Missing pi plates, RAL waiting for delivery but customs issues currently, should be en route to RAL today then transferred further
 - s/w dev ongoing
- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation
 - Figure out if dual hybrid test panels need to be respun
 - R3 test panels do not work reliably with 2 hybrids, some communication issues. Will respin R3 panels. Debugging is problematic due to marginal impedance control, works sometimes, sometimes not… 
 - Other test panels? Single hybrids
 - Similar status. We are validating 13 hybrids, powerboards, … 
 - Does not yet make sense to order prod quantities
 - If Freiburg knows of any working panel please let Dortmund know so they can go and produce (any, not fixed to R1)
 - What about panels for burn in crate?
 - Dennis can provide single panel with 1 hybrid
 - Also sensors will come back that Zeuthen loaned Fr
 - Sven: any estimate for how long it will take to figure this out?
 - Dennis: no
- Production of the common jigs required in the EC
 - Sergio sent email with new design for test jig (now on EDMS), as only minor comments we hope to go and approved after module ACs checked it
 - Oskar is waiting for those final drawings before progressing
- Production of R0 and R1 test frames
 - See above (EC hybrid test-panel finalisation), Fr working on validating current frames
- Production of R2 test frames
 - See above (EC hybrid test-panel finalisation), Fr working on validating current frames
 - R2 is closer to being validated, will be the first to finish
- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames
 - See above (EC hybrid test-panel finalisation), Fr working on validating current frames
- Production of LED bars for the EC
 - Majority of work taken on by Tynan now
 - Tynan has sent Dennis a design for R4, is waiting for validation from Dennis before tackling the other ones
 - Dennis will have a look at R4 design and give Tynan feedback
 - Update in 2 weeks
- Production of module frame cover for EC
 - Covers have not yet arrived, should arrive end of March
 - Update in 2 weeks
- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order
 - First batch hand populated, bug in footprint for one diode, have to redo pick and place files to hot-fix this for exchange diode
 - Hope to have them done in 2 weeks
### HV-Tab Cold Cycling Test
- Petal is considering to add a spacer/fishing line under tab below sensor to add some free space to allow for compensate of CTE expansion/shrinkage
 - Maybe consider a wiggle instead
 - Module folks to get into contact with loading folks to figure out a way to add wriggle room for tab when bonding to core. E.g. fishing line spacer, but dedicated tool probably better
 - Talk shows that normal mounting might be sufficient, but want to look into how to make it more reliable
- Will the tab be completely covered in glue or is there a void?
 - BNL: tab not covered in SE4445
 - Ingo: tab should not be covered with SE4445
### Dummy powerboards for gluing tests
- Printing bend powerboards for barrel sounds like a good idea
 - Also good to evaluate endcap tools
- Resin printing in house
 - Freiburg: hybrids bend a lot in post-curing process; need to get parameters wright
 - Zeuthen will get online resin printing soon
 - Canada (who was that?) also has a small printer and would be happy to help
- Vitaliy: are there metrology results as input to produce bend hybrids?
 - Karol: currently no plan to do any detailed metrology
 - Maybe use powerboard pick-up tool to measure it from the bottom to get shape
### AOB
- Vitaliy
 - Long term tests with hybrids and modules, specially for sensor humidity issues
 - Also long hybrid burn in
 - Would be very useful, also for module PRR
 - Use end of PPA or beginning of PPB parts to do this
 - For SQ DB interaction need to be ready, so having a dedicated module DB meet might be useful
 - Target to have this in 3 weeks
- Luise
 - announcing that we will discuss weighing QC comments in the QA/QC meeting this Thursday
- Sven
 - Please send recipient address for hybrid crate electronics to Ash
 - Email, Phone Nr, Shipping address, Name
 - One address for european deliveries please, then redistribute
