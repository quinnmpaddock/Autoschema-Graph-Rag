## Minutes
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- Nothing
### Barrel powerboard update (Timon)
- Previously had decided to have no fuses
 - Fuse is only there in the EC at the moment
 - More likely to blow accidentally than protect anything?
 - Reduces reliability of the detector?
 - What do we know about fuse reliability in our environment, have to be very sure that the fuse is more reliable than the powerboard for it to make sense
 - The powerboard is anyway designed for high reliability already
 - If you don’t have a fuse and you’re hoping wire-bonds fuse, potentially leaves a load of material in the tracker volume
 - Discussion concludes no fuses
- Does the longer HVret reference to hybrid GND potentially induce noise?
 - It is potentially close to the CMD lines so could add a ground trace between to shield somewhat laterally
- What is the width of the HVret reference trace?
 - Answer = 250 um -> same as on Ash’s original powerboard
 - This avoids common impedance coupling between HVret and other currents so route directly to hybrid LVret instead
- Want to manufacture soon to be able to test these things?
 - Straight to 250, hesitant to go straight for this but Timon points out that most can go to powerboard testing anyway
 - Can also be used on hybrid panels if not okay for modules
 - In hand middle to end of May?
- How quickly can we see whether the changes have done what they should?
 - Once back in labs it’s quick to get the powerboard on a module
 - Worry is that given the issues we have seen in the past, testing on a stave will be a requirement to go forward
 - Once we return to labs, US and UK to use barrel planning meeting to work out where/when is best placed to get modules with new powerboards on staves (in the right place) ASAP
### Visual Inspection (Jane)
- Delayed to next meeting
### Wire bonding (Forest)
- Carried similar things out on hybrids and powerboards
 - Often (always) other potential issues that makes it difficult to do similar thing with hybrids/tabs etc.
- This is a good standard candle that shows the procedure can work
 - At least it shows that if something does change, it is a real effect and not a weird variation
 - Cicorel is at least a good standard candle for looking at the range over a powerboard or hybrid
- Often other hardware does not have enough space to do similar things anyway…
- Are any of these things transferable to other systems?
 - In some cases, yes (force?) in others, no (US power?)
 - In past agreed that would not try to transfer parameters, just metrics of things going well (ie. pull tests) to maintain a good process
### AoB
- AUW next week - agenda to come...
