# 06/09/2022 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1191854/
### Introduction
- Carles: do you want 4 modules in the cold box?
 - Luise: yes
 - Carles: how to report results?
 - Luise: first need everyone to do the test, then need to look into how to collect the information
- Carles: what is the cold jig meeting?
 - Luise: work group working on module thermal cycling
 - Ankush: cover everything
- Ingo: would this still fit with the powerboard inside of the envelope?
 - Luise: it is only 200um
 - Dennis: depending on which mechanism it is to mitigate the thicker glue, should we not test it rather with the future glue candidate?
 - Luise: sure, if we know which it is
 - Dennis: a different glue might behave differently
 - Luise: UK has already build modules with true blue
 - Luise: there is some good news: Henkel might be able to sell true blue in larger packages. It this works, we can potentially change to that
- Tony: cold noise meeting on Thursday, if you have any slides please sento to Tony
 - Ashley: has sent some slides, but I’m not available for the meeting

Next week: 
### Experience from PPB1 end-cap hybrid assembly
- Dennis: short in R1 panel, most likely the connector (solder between feet)
 - Luise: is there any QC done on the panels before they are shipped?
 - Dennis: no
 - Luise: can there something be done?
 - Dennis: this type of short is easy to spot, others are harder
- Forest: concern on the wire bonding side: have you tried cleaning pads to see if the peel rate improves?
 - JJ: not quite sure, will have to ask
 - Forest: is Celestica making the hybrids? Or are they just doing the assembly?
 - JJ: just the assembly
 - Forest: up until now, we cleaned all barrel hybrids
 - Luise: we are in discussion with Freiburg about cleaning all hybrids before they be shipped
 - Forest: going to 50% deformation to meet the specification need to check that the bond feet are not damaged
 - JJ: also would be good to compare
 - Tony: what about the pull tests on the coupons?
 - Zeuthen did some pull tests on coupons
 - Ingo: if force is OK and you don’t have any lift-offs, Forest why are you concerned about heel cracking?
 - Forest: there are a lot of degrees of cracking and 50% of deformation is quite a bit
 - Ingo: you might not catch the edge cases in the pull tests. 
 - Forest: pull tests are also in ideal conditions, not like on a real object
- Vitaliy: believe the heel becomes a weak point when oversqueezing, CMS had this problem and found it can cause problems. Would be good to see how much the bond foot is squashed (compared to specification)
 - JJ: hope the next batch of hybrids will be better
 - Ingo: best way forward is cleaning
 - Luise: want to avoid that everyone has to clean in house
- Luise (slide 11): we need to agree on wether we want to use hybrids with one or two bad ASICs. Considering the hybrid shortage, we probably have to need those
 - Ingo: would support this. If ASICs break during production, then we need to stop this, but this looks more like a config issue
 - Luise: also one panel of each type is send to Freiburg for tests, so they could look at config issues
 - JJ: how can I make sure its a readout issue?
 - Dennis: you know for sure if they work. Usually ASICs either work or fail, there should not be a subtle failure
 - Luise: did you send this errors to the ITSDAQ expert list?
 - JJ: yes
 - Luise: if you followed all their advice, its more worrying. Then would send them to Freiburg for expert help. It would be good to also send the config files when doing this.
- Luise: don’t know what to do about the R5 situation
 - Dennis: most likely a config issue or bonding
 - JJ: should we use the hybrid or just wait?
 - Dennis: if you can, you should wait until I can do some tests. The new panel should not be worse than the old version
 - Luise: can you look at R5 panel before the last is assembled?
 - Dennis: yes, if this works for Toronto
 - Luise: in production we would probably throw out a panel that is not working, but not sure what to do now
 - Ingo: can panels be tested on a tape testing robot?
 - Dennis: not really
 - Ingo: PCBs are tested by manufacturer?
 - Dennis: yes, so it is most likely something about the soldering
 - Luise: can we do a test with a powerboard to check for a short?
 - Dennis: only for power, but not for other features
 - Luise: if we have instructions on how to do a panel test, we can do it.
 - JJ: should we move one or two of the problematic hybrids to a different panel?
 - Dennis: should not make a difference. Would prefer to have a look at them in Freiburg first.
### Testbeam summary (DESY, August/September)
- Andy: do you have any idea about the MultiIO board
 - Jiri: we used previous generation of FE-I4 in June, where we had some issues (buffer size, dead pixel)
 - John: online monitor worked in most scans we did
 - Andy: good to see!
 - John: we did look into this in old runs, if the buffer filled it desynched, and then recovered after 6 
 - Andy: did you see the cold noise in any other module before?
 - Jiri: no
 - John: we also have never done such a detailed ramp
 - Vitaliy: were the chips on these modules irradiated?
 - John: no
 - Dennis: were they on R1?
 - Jiri: Yes, they were pre-irradiated
 - Andy: and this is an irradiated sensor?
 - Jiri, yes all sensors were irradiated
