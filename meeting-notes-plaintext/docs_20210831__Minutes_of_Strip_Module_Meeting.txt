# 31/08/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1054928/ 
### Introduction
- Update on 
 - Karola and Luise sort out R4 in between them
 - Documentation for hybrid bonding works, needs further work on module bond documentation
 - Help is also needed on hybrid documentation to document proper numbering for database - volunteers needed!
- Discussion on issues encountered with first runs of hybrid crate in Canada
 - Dennis and Ash will look at effects and help fixing
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R0 tool production
 - Exchange feedback on the sheet shared by Luise
 - Some issues fitting R0 pickups into hybrid panels
 - Marc will check in Freiburg how the misfit might have occurred and get back to William and Karo
 - Richard B will send a doodle for a meeting on R1 and R0 tools for potential workarounds
 - There is also a confusion on how many R1 tools were supposed to have been made / the number of bushings needed
- R1 tool production
 - See above
- R2 tool production
 - Mixup with fast track tools so only hybrid tools were delivered :(
 - However rest of tools have been set for anodisation today and the first of these tools will be sent to Luise as fast as we can manage
 - Metrology on non anodised parts looked very good now
- R4 tool production
 - supposed to receive tools, but company had issues with machine (not even full order)
 - Finding out with legal team to push the company into gear
 - waiting for response from company
 - try to get at least one set of tools for each site
 - So far hinging on company that is not cooperating
- Barrel hybrid tendering/order
 - Everybody on holiday for signing contract
- UK/China module thermal cycling setup
 - No Ankush here today, will postpone
- Production of bonding and testing jigs & stencils today
 - Bonding and testing jigs are ready, only paperwork left to be able to send
 - Stencils
 - Internal steel material ready
 - Frames are missing, material is not available, expect arrival in one week
- Production of hybrid panel cover
 - fully done with production, currently packaging for shipping to DESY
- Production of LED bars
 - all soldered, in process of being glued to aluminium bars,
 - will be shipped to other sites soon
 - seen one issue with R1 bar in canada, Dennis will check
- EC glass dummy sensors
 - R0, R4 and R5 shipped out to module sites
 - R1 and R3 on the way from company to Scandinavia, will be distributed from there
 - R2 not ordered yet, still issues with order form in Dortmund, Mike is following up
### Module handling recommendations
- Sensors can go into bad state (local low interstrip resistance) when picked up from a charged up surface
- Mitigations required
 - Modules: all jigs have options to be grounded and HAVE TO BE connected to ground
 - It is sufficient to do so occasionally (e.g. once a day) as long as no charge accumulates in the jigs
 - Vacuum pen should be grounded when picking up sensors or at least the operator of the vac pen has be be ESD safe / grounded
 - Module frames have a means of being grounded, but not sure if dessicator can charge up the module
 - This will have to be observed carefully
 - All desiccators / dry storage should be ESD safe!
 - Might have to use a dedicated HV/LV molex cable for the module frame that is grounded on all pins and connected during module handling with the trame on a jig
- Marcella: If not violating ESD safety measures, surfaces/jigs will not charge up
 - Vitaliy: dry air can create charge up though
- This would lead to a module failing QC
### HV tab QC discussion
- Cleaning: are the tabs rinsed after alcohol bath (IPA) -> no
 - Concern that bath not clean and leaves residues from cleaning on tabs
 - Recommended to rinse afterwards again with alcohol to remove those residues
- HV-Tab sheets: will be cut in half because it's easier to handle
 - Need to review database implementation of HV tabs
 - All sheets should also be clearly labeled.
 - TonyW is happy to call each half sheet size 25 (even if there are 26 tabs there)
- Yield so far very bad (Kirsten reports about 45%)
- Endcap sites concerned that very extensive sight qualy requirement (20 pulls in a row with at least 300g) not manageable with the number of tabs received if yield is this low
- Might have to re-visit site quali requirements, allow smaller numbers of pull tests for endcap groups
- Ingo to inspect tabs received more closely to report what yield for endcap tabs seems to be
- SCIPP cleans all HV-tabs (also straightens out the tabs)
- Future batches will have a more systematic visual inspection at Oxford before shipping
- Where will the HV-tab sheets be registered in the database?
 - Oxford? ->
- HV tab sheets should have a ATLAS SN
 - Batch number encoded
 - A sequential serial number for the sheets
 - This is then merged into the HV-tab sheet serial number
 - Missing: YY identifier for HV-Tab sheets
### [moved to next module meet after ITk week] Module Assembly: early vacuum removal follow up
-
