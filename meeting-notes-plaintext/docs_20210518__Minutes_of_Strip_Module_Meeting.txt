# 18/05/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1032180/ 
### Introduction
- Dennis promises to provide bond documentation for endcap hybrids at the time the hybrids are getting shipped out
- Need drawings for metrology for endcap hybrids, module models can be used but we need to find a volunteer to sit down and make drawings out of them
- No feedback received on last round of module drawings
- Sergey can make hybrid drawings for the module types he was working on, Carles to check with Guillem if the same is true for him
- Ask reviewers to give feedback about the process
 - Bart: initially was not very clear where and to whom to comment when review is finished. The process might be a bit susceptible to fraud (someone approving a review that wasn’t approved by the reviewer
- Jig cleaning and hybrid shipping now ready for site qualification
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R0 tool production
- R3 tool production
- EC PPA/prototype hybrid order
- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)
- Barrel hybrid tendering/order
- EC hybrids/powerboard tendering
- Powerboard testing setup roll-out
- UK/China module thermal cycling setup
- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out
- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation
- Production of stencils for the EC
- Production of module frame cover for EC
- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order
All sites please purchase all the required Nexys and Genesys G2 boards NOW! (global shortage of Si parts makes unavailability, in the near future, likely - see e.g. the MicroZed board (current delivery time: 52 weeks))
### Update polaris handling/storage
- Would be good to store glue in dark container
- Need to be cautious when storing glue cold, since this affects viscosity when mixing
- No concerns about requested changes -> will be implemented, then site qualification can start
### 
### ESD suction cups on modules
- Gerrit: Only clear silicone cups don’t leave remnants
- Conclusion: don’t use ESD suction cups.
- Karola: would be good to send an email with the recommended suction cup type to group
 - Gerrit: highly recommends to use FIPA cups
 - https://www.fipa.com/us/sfu-a-o-6-mm-102-006-013/
 - Cup material: SI (Look for 102.006.013.2/17)
### IV curve data format
- Wafer number and sensor component number redundant, but use both to help with wrong user input
- Use correct signs for voltage and current for raw data (as recorded by your measurement system), but plots should use “positive” signs
- 
### ABCStarV1 Classification (maybe next week)
- 
- J
### AOB
- None
