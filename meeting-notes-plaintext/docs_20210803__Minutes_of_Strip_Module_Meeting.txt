# 03/08/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1054924/
### Introduction
- What is keeping people up on qualifying for the bond pulling?
 - If it is the test parts (failed ASICs, sensor half-moons, flex test coupons, HV-tabs), we need to make sure they get send around ASAP
 - For the pull-test QC, only required to do tests on cicorel cards
- For metrology SQ
 - EC will need “real” parts to avoid issues with wrong optical measurements
- Need a discussion about the module glue amount
 - Not clear which values were agreed upon in January meeting and values in EDMS document for module assembly
- Need to make sure minutes gets released to collaboration and decisions are clearly tracked and highlighted
- Glue volume discussion:
 - There are minutes from the relevant meeting 2021-01-19

 - We agree to go with 147 +/- 20 mg
 - We will have to check if UK stencils need to be adjusted
 - Get data from PPA with the current barrel stancil about fill factor/achieved glue weight; use this data to design the PPB stencils for the new hybrid geometry
- Need to decide on the process of releasing PPA module parts
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R0 tool production
 - Spares are not out but all sites should have received R0 tools
 - Toronto tools are still in transit, DHL lead time is 26 days, and delivery is sill in that frame
 - Rework for spare parts are in progress in workshop
- R1 tool production
 - Remove bushings, reinsert - this might help fit
 - Otherwise if time allows ship tools back to Richard for rework / re-fit
 - Richard will follow up to chase missing parts
- R2 tool production
 - How will re-reaming be done? Not sure
 - This is what destroyed the R4 tools, so need to plan it carefully
 - Will try to use precise CNC machine that built the tools
 - If we cannot will fall back to careful artisan work
- R3 tool production
 - Some tools do not seal well, silicone from R5 is great, might go same route
 - Essentially done
 - Everything that was planned to send was sent
- R5 tool production
 - Tools have arrived at sites
 - Very carefully packaged
 - Look very good
 - Initial tests from Toronto look great
- Powerboard testing setup roll-out
 - EC ones submitted
 - EC also received the FPGA replacement boards
 - LBNL work ongoing with high prio
- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out
 - Fans arrived yesterday
 - Carl Beichert awaiting feedback from beta sites before work is started for CNC-ing
 - Simple copy and paste instructions on how to bring up the setup would be great on the twiki
 - Ash will check and add info
 - https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/Atlas/HybridBurnInCrate 
- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order
 - completed
- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)
- Barrel hybrid tendering/order
 - received quotation for pre-production circuits at Liverpool
 - everything looks OK and material is available
 - production time <35days, need to sign off documents to start
 - bare circuits might be in hand in September, not sure about contract for SMD population
- EC hybrids/powerboard tendering
 - In negotiations between companies and CERN
 - Companies asked questions, CERN is providing answers
 - Material availability is BIG unknown which will impact schedule / timeline
- Endcap module thermal cycling setup
 - Sergio will give update in 2 weeks (just back from holidays)
- UK/China module thermal cycling setup
 - Upgraded Birmingham ColdJig to be returned today.
 - In addition, Birmingham will be taking one of our spare chillers.
 - Order for IHEP shipping crate gone out.
 - When Craig Sawyer returns from leave, we will arrange the collection and shipping of the IHEP ColdJig
- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation
 - waiting for first EC electrical modules and results from those tests
- EC multiple module box transport box
 - Box loaded today with mechanical R2Star to be shipped to Valencia
 - Then back to Zeuthen
 - This is to be the final test before final sign off
 - Planned to finalised in 3 weeks (due to vacations)
- Production of bonding and testing jigs
 - Ready to be shipped this Friday
- Production of R0 and R1 test frames
 - waiting for first EC electrical modules and results from those tests
 - In parallel iterating with company for manufacturability 
- Production of R2 test frames
 - waiting for first EC electrical modules and results from those tests
 - Have to go through CERN tender so pre-order of SMD cannot be done
- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames
 - waiting for first EC electrical modules and results from those tests
 - In parallel iterating with company for manufacturability 
 - Also buying SMD parts already (due to long lead times)
 - Company is awaiting final go after first module tests
- Production of stencils
 - Postpone to next week
- Production of LED bars
 - First set sent to Ca
 - Remaining parts to be delivered after Dennis holiday
 - Week before ITk week
- Production of module frame cover
 - 
### AOB
- Polaris glue mixing ratio from company (100:15) is different than what we use (100:9)
 - Company confirms that it only affects pot life and cure time
 - Decision: stay with what we use
 -
