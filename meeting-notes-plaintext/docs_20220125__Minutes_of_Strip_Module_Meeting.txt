https://indico.cern.ch/event/1109665/
### Introduction
- No discussion
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- 25/01/2022: EC tasks
- 01/02/2022: Barrel tasks
- 08/02/2022: EC tasks
- 15/02/2022: Barrel tasks
- 22/02/2022: EC tasks
- R0 tool production
Still being anodised, not sure when they will come back
(new chip trays and spare R0 tools)
- R1 tool production
Second order placed, expect them to be back in 1 - 2 months
- R2 tool production
Second batch of module jigs has been anodised
Working on metrology, need to check anodisation
- R4 tool production
Tools are anodised and being assembled, waiting for bushings
- EC PPA/prototype hybrid order
Distributed to Canada and assembled
Waiting for DESY and Scandinavia to get qualified for hybrids to send those out
- Powerboard testing setup roll-out
Next powerboard type now available (R2), need panels for other types
Testing works, but not smoothly for up to 8, fails at some point in the chain
- Endcap module thermal cycling setup
There will be an update today
Waiting for documentation from DESY side, then can send them out
Then first three can be sent out
- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation
Need feedback
- Production of R0 and R1 test frames
- Production of R2 test frames
- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames
Still waiting for frames to be approved for production, then will start production
- Production of stencils
Stencil frames: production tricky because difficult to machine without bending, need to follow up
- Production of LED bars
	No updates
- R2�EC glass dummy sensors
Close this! Done
- SMD tendering for EC pre-production/production hybrids
Tender ongoing, as soon as we have a bidder we want, paperwork can be submitted, then CERN order can be placed
### Hybrid testing database implementation
- Andy: scripts that use the database interaction, do they live on database or ITSDAQ repo?
 - Christian: will be on the database repo
 - Andy: no plan for ITSDAQ GUI to call these?
 - Christian: no
- William: get_components.py requires that components are already assembled in database?
 - Get components is only checking all the parts and children
 - Script then uses components and fuseIDs to map the child component to component under test
 - William: it assumes that hybrids are already assembled in the database with the correct children?
 - Bruce: yes, will expect database assembly to be correct;
 - Need a check to see if FuseIDs match components in the database
 - Andy: if there a preference what fuseID is correct? Order of hierarchy?
 - Bruce: look up which hybrid by HCC, then check the ABC fuseIDs
 - If wrong, disassemble them and assemble the correct part
 - Craig: it’s kind of tricky and will probably require some manual intervention since ITSDAQ can’t know the flex ID without user input
 - ASICs are mapped, but hybrid flex is the difficult bit
 - Luise: if you have 10 wrong ASICs, than it might be you have the wrong hybrid
 - Vitaliy: maybe another script to look in the database for the wrong fuse ID to find out what is wrong (and why)
 - Luise: this is part of the hybrid assembly qualification task
 - Christian: is it checked during assembly?
 - Luise: no, it needs electrical tests first and from that a file to compare against the database assembly
 - Vitaliy: would be good to have something that helps the operator in case something is wrong
- Luise: most likely will not work for prototype parts because ASICs are not in database?
 - Christian: yes
- Luise: is there a way to upload tests even if there are no information about the ASICs?
 - Christian: need the hybrid assembly serial number to upload something (and need institute location code)
- Luise: do you keep the name PPA or will you change it?
 - Christian: currently to distinguish the PPA test from the currently implemented test in the database
 - Luise: it is possible to use the PPA version throughout production?
 - Christian: yes, could also delete old tests
- Luise: on what timescale is it going to be implemented?
 - Bruce: waiting for me to do some work
 - Christian: also some json output needs more work
 - Luise: 2 weeks, 1 week?
 - Silence
 - Bruce: try to do it in one week
 - Luise: do you need anything from groups to help with it? Test data?
 - Bruce: yes, PPA root files would be useful
 - William: OK, could provide them (but not time walk)
 - Craig: full test doesn’t currently include timewalk
- Luise: mentioned that there would be error messages if something goes wrong. How would they look like?
 - Christian: they will tell what error happened (e.g. wrong stage, wrong institute, …)Messages printed in terminal and also into a log fileSometimes also get warnings (e.g. wrong database key that will be ignored)
- Andy: is this going to be scaled up to module loading?
 - Christian: guess so, but only looked at PPA hybrids
 - Luise: there is a dedicated discussion for module testing later; loading sites are just doing module tests so should follow same scheme
- Luise: are you going to update the testing procedure dokument?
 - Christian: the google dokument?
 - Luise: yes, update google dokument and then do another EDMS review
- JJ: upload.py script is compatible with current json files?
 - Bruce: ITSDAQ will need fixing. Could re-analyse old root files to get correct format
- William: what when testing at different locations?
 - Christian: for upload should work, could also get the list for components from multiple institutes

### Discussion of DB questions for single module testing
- Luise: is testing a module the same as testing a hybrid? Can the module testing procedure document refer to the hybrid dokument for that?
 - Vitaly: don’t think hybrid and module are similar. Module test should also include bias voltage and might also include more information about the powerboardsTest structure should be different
- Luise: should there be an additional test for the environmental information?
 - Bruce: should be header information in result
- Luise: for module, is the bad channel definition similar to hybrids (are cut’s similar)
 - Discussed in meeting on Thursday
 - Vitaly: parameters should be different between hybrid and module
 - Bruce: X and Y hybrids on a module will have same cuts, but probably not for EC 
 - Craig: hybrid level, cuts should be the same
 - Dennis: yes, but not on modules due to different variable
- Luise: then there would be different tests for hybrids and modules in the database
 - Vitaliy: yes
 - Bruce: will have to check on exactly what to do; tests are mostly the same just need some extra information
 - Luise: need to follow up once we have agreed on hybrid testing
### Endcap coldbox control PCB
- Dennis: how many spare crimp contacts can you supply?
 - Alexander: yes, will supply some
 - Dennis: make it at least 100 each
- How much power do you need to power the peltier elements
 - Roughly 15V and 6A (to be checked)
 - Geoffrey: polarity switch is rated higher
 - UK/China (?) using 10 bench power supplies (single channel)
 - Alexander: design of box between barrel and EC is different so not necessarily compatible
 - Sergio: 8W of dissipated power is not enough for heating
- Need to check this to make sure they work!
- Alexander: do we want to discuss humidity sensor mounting here?
 - Sergio: probably better to discuss it offlineBut, humidity sensors need to be inside sensor air volume to get a good reading, e.g. using a T adapter
 - Dennis: wouldn’t it be better to flow air over the sensor?
 - Sergio: sensor does not fit in tube
 - Dennis: you have to connect the T to the sensor as well
 - Sergio: there is an inlet and outlet for the air going to the sensor
 - Dennis: why can’t the sensor be on the exhaust? Are you concerned about the nitrogen?
 - William: had the same concerns
 - Sergio: you assume that the air is warmed up from the module. We are injecting cold air into the system
 - Dennis: you don’t want the warm air inside of the box
 - Sergio: dry air that is injected into box is cooled down, if you use exhaust, you are inserting warm air
 - Dennis: worry with T is the stagnant air that needs time to get to the same humidity value
 - Alexander: wouldn’t it be turbulent?
 - Dennis: no, festo is designed not to be turbulent
 - Sergio: alternative would be a housing inside the ESD foam, but this would have to be done for every single module and the foam would have to be re-worked
### First module gain correlations
- Luise: what would be the best way to present own data? Send it to you or should sites to it themselves?
 - Vitaliy: can set something up to collect the information
- Luise: are there instructions on how the read out the hybrid NTC?
 - Vitaly: I don’t have any. Bruce would probably know.
 - Dennis: 2000 numbers are from ABCs
 - William: 3 digit numbers are from HCC
 - Dennis: for hybrid NTC there is a calibration, I can read out the values
 - Luise: how?
 - Dennis: use one of the AMAC functions, but not sure which is the official one
 - Dennis: calibration is not properly done yet, therefore no official instructions
 - Luise: would be good to invite ITSDAQ experts to explain how to do this
