# 19/09/2023 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1289857/
### Introduction
Slide 9
- Bart: there is a big difference if a sensor sits at a higher current limit for a long time
 - Luise: general IV current limit has been updated to 10uA
Slide 12
- Sarah: hard to order FalseBlue from Europe
 - Dennis: we could order, but direct payment to US is troublesome
 - Pavol: could not pay via invoice, needed to buy via card
 - Luise: maybe it might be worth finding a distribution site in Europe that has less issues procuring the glue
- No disagreements with Proposal
Slide 13
- Carles: tried to compare new and old R5 stencils, are you sure they are there?
 - Follow this up offline
Slide 16
- Tony: SE4445 from Fermilab does not seem to have noise
 - Tony: others need bond fixing
 - Luise: might be interesting to also compare test conditions
Ingo in chat:
we tried using the bipack - we found very clearly that the ratio is not consistent either with the one targeted by us nor between bipacks, so we will continue to measure the hardener and epoxy individually
we cannot get consistent results when using bipacks, whereas we get to within about +-2% with weighed mixing
just wanted to convey this find (which was new to us) as we are on glues...
- Luise: try to avoid bipacks
### ITSDAQ news
Operation Spotlight
- Vitaliy: can you create an artificial pinhole in the area you illuminate?
 - Vitaliy: bond AC pad to DC pad
 - Cole: can do
 - Vitaliy: may be an issue that BNL has outlined that it is possible for the front-end amplifier to compete with the AMAC amplifier if there is such a connection. Then the IV test results become weird/questionable. Maybe also noise results might be affected
 - Peter: two DESY modules at DESY did not show problem, so no pinholes? (ist das was er gesagt hat?)
 - Vitaliy: would still prefer test to be done, effect on AMAC IV is the only effect measurable after irradiation, because we need to know this
 - Peter: have a module with a couple dozen artificial pinholes on it
ITSDAQ Update
- Tony: the other thing we need is the merging script and what we want to do for the cold cycle upload
 - Cole: rumour has it that someone from US has uploaded it to the database
 - Tony: yes, for burnin it is easy; but for thermal cycling there are additional test data that need to be uploaded
 - Bruce: try to work out burn-in first
 - Bruce: there was an update last week or so which should fix the merger script for burn-in data
 - Sven: can confirm that it works (with the test type name)
 - Bruce: there were two merge requests in parallel
 - Tony: for the cold box, there is an open discussion of what we want to do/upload and what to merge
 - Cole: procedure is sorted out and being implemented, finalising procedure in datavase
 - Tony: we have 4 IVs, do we upload all of them individually or merge them somehow with the cold test data, …
 - Bruce: don’t think there is something wrong with this
 - Tony: depends on how the data analysis is done (and how people later want to access the data)
 - Luise: Mo is also volunteering to help, so we should start an email discussion
 - Tony: also need to keep the run-number issue in mind [manual runs on several days]
 - Luise: for merging, most of it is easy?
 - AMAC IVs can be uploaded individual
 - Open question about merging cold and warm individually
 - Tony: for individual IVs you would have to pull them by timestamp
 - Luise: or use a comment
 - Tony: there are different ways, just need to converge to a common method
### End-cap powerboard testing instructions
Slide 
- Cole: R2 doesn’t need inversion - but it should, right?
 - Ben: maybe I got this wrong
 - Cole: R2 does need the conversion, I’m fairly sure
 - Dennis: R2 is similar to R3, R4, & R5
- Roland: page 15, serial numbers won’t be on the shield box, but they will have a serial number sticker on them
 - Ben: will add that
- Luise: for database question, do you want to start and email thread to discuss this?
 - Ben: already started an email thread a while ago. Need to follow this up again
 - Luise: maybe also talk with Dennis/Karol to see how barrel has done this
 - Dennis will add other people that need to be added
- William: question about slide 15: is it the serial number that goes into these boxes or the ID that should go into these boxes
 - Dennis: should be 28
 - Dennis: EC powerboard only have 28 on shieldbox. But on carrier next to powerboard is the full serial number on a sticker
 - William: is there a full database record of the panel? Do we really need to fill in all powerboards by hand?
 - Ben: yes, can just enter the panel number and then it will fill all the needed information automatically
 - William: that would be great
 - Ben: not sure if it works with the powerboard type yet
 - Dennis: for EC you can put in the ATLAS serial number of the carrier. They also have a QR code with the serial number. This has the powerboard type encoded and would be the most convenient type to do
 - Ben: need to add this
 - Dennis: just use the QR handreader.
 - William: does the Z-turn recognize the QR reader?
 - Dennis: the interface is a web interface on the computer (not the z-turn)
 - Ben: Dennis: could you test it with the serial number of the carrier?
 - Dennis: yes, can also send serial numbers which work
### Endcap Module Metrology: R0-R5. Preliminary analysis before PRR
Slide 14
- Ewan: do we do any metrology on powerboards after assembly?
 - Dennis: on all recent industry assembled powerboards there will be a pass/fail
 - Ewan: where?
 - Dennis: done in Freiburg when they come back from industry
- Dennis: can comment that newer flexes are also hand populated so flatness is not indicative to industry populated flexes
 - Luise: Only R4 & R5 are industry populated (latest non-cuvred)
 - Luise: maybe for new ones, could you add a comment that they were populated in industry?
 - Dennis: yes, can do
 - Ewan: (slide 14) outlier is an R4.
 - Dennis: but even if they were industry populated, the shieldbox was not
- Pavol: measure all R2 and R4 powerboards before mounting - can send you Prague data if you like for pre/post gluing comparison
 - Ewan: that would be great. 
 - Pavol: can confirm that flatness of powerboards is not good and flex height has a large variation
- Pavol: when we have industry populated powerboards, can we reject powerboards which are out of spec?
 - Dennis: not many. It is just following the yield table and we will produce this
 - Dennis: the idea is that for every started module there will be a powerboard distributed and we hope the that the yield for SMD population and assembly are fine
 - Pavol: and if powerboard is too bad to make a module, should we send it back?
 - Dennis: there is a yield for powerboard production, so we hope it will be covered by this
 - Pavol: okay
 - Dennis: also, QC so far wasn’t good enough 
- I
- William: surely we don’t have <100um tolerance on petals. Where does the cut come from?
 - Luise: envelope comes from EC loading site.
 - Ingo: this is the upper limit. There is no room there
 - Dennis: insertion is reasonably tight
 - Luise: this is supposed to be a hard cut and with new tools/powerboards we should be able to hit this
 - Ewan: more details on documentation would be good. For barrel the tolerance is based on build-up from known tolerances
- Luise (PRR related comment): would be good to mark which of those were good and which are out of spec based on old tools and powerboard types
 - Ewan: this is not a draft for the PRR talk
 - Luise: hopefully we can get more data for the PRR
- I
Slide 3
- Luise: from database it is not possible to say if the powerboards have the larger coils or not
 - Dennis: all flexes V4.x have the larger coils
Second set of slides form Laurelle postponed to next week
