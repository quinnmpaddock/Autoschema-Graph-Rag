# 10/08/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1054925/ 
### Introduction
- Site Qualification News
 - module assembly goes live now
 - all other steps are out apart from 
 - electrical test (to come in future) and 
 - module metrology which the SQ doc task force will be looking at this week
- sasd
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R4 tool production
 - company will remake
 - plan to be done this week with manufac
 - then send to anno
 - ready for delivery by end of August
- Powerboard testing setup roll-out
 - new FPGA board had some issues
 - all other parts have arrived
 - FW and SW is tagged and ready to ship
 - small USB connection issue might need quick check
- Production of bonding and testing jigs
 - Karo heard from Oscar:
 - bonding jigs should have started shipping
 - testing jigs to follow
- Production of EC stencils
 - R0 and R1 started production
 - ready for shipping this week
 - rest to follow order of a week later
- Please open task for EC glass dummy sensors
 - R0 and R4 sent
 - R1, 3 and 5?
 - Scan has paid but company drags out delivery
 - Dortmund will report next week
 - Created new task, still need to add proper list of people
### First star hybrid results from Toronto
- Ash: PCIe connector panels are used?
 - yes
- What about hybrids that have too high glue weight but no disturbing squeeze out
 - They pass according to doc
 - Mark as passed in DB but please add comment that the glue weight is above pass value and they pass on this special clause
- Bendy EC hybrids, hard to suck down
 - Likely caused by hybrid release option from flex array - barrel found that the retainer with pips (rather than laser cut allround and small thin layer left) is better for suppressing bending
 - We need to check with Kambiz to please follow barrel example
 - Is bendiness everywhere?
 - Yes, stronger in HCC area, but small stats
- Finish R1H0 first now to fulfill Celestica contract while waiting for other toolsets

### Module Assembly: Vacuum
- Sarah: what if it got bumped after removing pickup tool after 6 hours?
 - There could be some xy position variance but unclear
 - In theory this could happen but if there are no earthquakes we do not expect this
- If we could use this option we could glue hybrids in the morning and add the PB overnight, which could speed up things nicely
- Glue does not seem to be moving in xy seeing how hard it already is after 6 hours
- How can we ensure that this is safe?
 - Maybe do a slightly cruder test using glass slides and show that the positions are the same when cured 6 or 24 hours?
 - We could also do shear tests and prove that the shear does not change between 6 and 24 hour cure?
 - A bit indirect though
- This method has been used in prototyping when time was tight, but we did not get the relevant metrology
- Discussion if this would run against the 8 hour work day if we tried to glue hybrids in the morning and PB at the end of the day
### Tool Discussion
- Issue seems tied to anodisation in bushing holes
- Discuss here how to solve
 - Toronto took bushings out, very carefully with the use of a micrometer, work down the outer diameter and reinsert
- Richard will send out working tools and sites can return non-working tools for fixing
