## Minutes
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- Upgrade week schedule will come out shortly (being finalised over next day or so)
- HV tab update (watching brief):
 - Forest and DESY have found good bond strengths for HV tab on core
 - Contingent on proper cleaning before attempting (see Forest’s slides)
- Local support (core and loading) FDR happening Wednesday/Thursday this week
- Increased noise on stave seen at cold temperature at BNL is under investigation
 - Some redesign of module/hybrid/powerboard not precluded but investigation needs to continue
### EC transport box (Dennis)
- Module has been run with this foam on top
- Could do with N2 outlet areas?
 - Need to test how porous it is the first place
- How is the foam cleaned after cutting?
 - Doesn’t leave marks if kept clean by not touching
 - Bare foam not dirty or contaminating
 - If people touch it how to wash
 - Not ultrasonic cleaning
 - DI water cleaning should be okay (a la suction cups)
- Will Freiburg be able to provide foam etc. for everyone?
 - Full structure takes 4 mins but time can be saved when doing multiple ones
 - 1 FTE month of work estimated - not unreasonable
 - For pre-production, definitely, production, maybe
### Funny/interesting presentation (Sven)
- Could use this to rework hybrids by gluing chips on top rather than replacing bad chips
 - Note that hybrid has to be glued on a sensor before you do this so that the tools work in the hybrid-sensor gluing step
- Good to know that in principle we can do this!
 - But not recommended!!
### QC groups: electrical test (Ruchi)
- Vitaliy currently writing document defining steps etc. to do IV scans
- 10V/10s for ramp is needed for current measurements, for “just” ramping faster can be done
 - 10V/1s suggested and no complaints
- AMAC testing
 - Primarily calibration of the AM slope/offsets etc. tests most of the functionality
 - What about interlocking? Not sure…
- Confirmation testing
 - From FDR should do confirmation test at high end of thermal cycle
 - This is what is done at reception testing
 - Use trim from database (reception testing) or previously derived one (thermal cycling)
 - Also need to add a characterisation at end of thermal cycle at 20C for comparison to reception testing (could be done at same time as HV stability)
- What about double trigger noise or digital tests?
 - Could well be added
 - Would need to discuss with chip/DAQ people to understand what is useful on that side
- How to define bad channels etc.?
 - Nathan has write up
 - Possible proposal to include a low bias run to enhance difference between bonded and unbonded channels for characterisation
 - Need to harmonise over all the places this is written down
 - <1% is written in the module specs
- Reception testing
 - How to know the module that you are testing and relate to module tests
 - Idea was that DAQ can readout FuseIDs to get configuration/trims etc. from the database
- Hybrid electrical testing
 - Ben/Ash hoping to have something to present soon
 - Should be brought to module meeting for discussion ASAP
### HV tab bonding (Forest)
- DESY have seen similar improvement in bonding when cores are properly cleaned
### AoB
- Reminder to fill out QC surveys from Karola
