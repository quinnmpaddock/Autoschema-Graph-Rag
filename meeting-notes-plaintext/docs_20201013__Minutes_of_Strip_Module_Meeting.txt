### BNL and SCIPPs suction cup investigations for module shipping
- UK placed order for 600 silicone and 600 anti static cups to test both
- Hole size in transport frame for suction cups were slightly off in first version, which results in them falling out
 - Was fixed in updated version for injection moulded frames
- If antistatic cups donâ€™t shed or have adverse effect, they could be used
- Baseline standard silicone cups
 - If groups are interested, they could research impacts of anti-static cups
### AOB
- CraigW points out that all QC/procedural docs are late. Thanks a lot, still, to all that contributed so far! Some of them are effectively finished, some others have only minor issues - please feel encouraged to finish the docs up!
