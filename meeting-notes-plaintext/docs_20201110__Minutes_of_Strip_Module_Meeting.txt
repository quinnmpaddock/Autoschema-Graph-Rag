# 10/11/20 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/927527/
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- P2UG went as well as we could hope given current delays
### Task tracker items
- EC PPA/prototype hybrid order Urgent Late
 - Expected delivery time 25-30 days, submitted a month ago, so should be coming in these days
 - Issues encountered in failure analysis: broken vias in x-section views
 - Will redo sheets with issues, will cause 1-2 weeks delay
 - Overall thickness 241 micrometers (prod target was 250 +-10%)
 - Marc had assumed 270 microns
 - Assembly stuffing will go to other company (local in Fr)
 - Expect fast turnaround of about 3-4 weeks after having handed the unstuffed hybrids to the “stuffers”
 - The thinner than expected hybrids will be a problem for tooling
 - Could try and put shims under hybrids (bad for vacuum, hybrids not flat, difficult and messy)
 - Could say we just live with 30µm thicker glue layer (doesn’t make difference in bonding, glue amount should be controlled to be sufficient)
 - Could adjust tool drawings → too much work for short term use (don’t know final thickness yet) - will not do this
 - Currently hybrids from Wuerth, for PPB and full prod tendering still running
- EC hybrids/powerboard tendering Urgent In progress
 - Kambiz filling ID documents for tender
 - slowed by ongoing noise problem to be solved first
 - Kambiz focussed also on finalising test frames, getting onto tender again now
- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation Urgent Late
 - Finalised and will be uploaded to EDMS for review to start, can go ahead
- EC module test frame finalisation Urgent Late
 - Finalised and will be uploaded to EDMS for review to start, can go ahead
- R0 tool production Urgent Late
- R3 tool production Urgent Late
 - Got prototypes back (after initial pre-bushing interaction)
 - Looks quite good, will do systematic metrology (some measurements up to 5 microns out of tolerance, but that is within measurement precision)
 - Have 2D drawings on EDMS and review ongoing
- UK/China hybrid/module tool production Normal Late
- UK/China powerboard tool production Normal Late
- Barrel PPA hybrid order Urgent Late
 - order has gone out end of last week
 - 30-35 day turnaround and then 2-3 weeks for SMD
 - expect circuits mid-December at absolute best (probably Jan!)
- UK/China module thermal cycling setup Urgent In progress
 - Will deliver 7
 - One at B’ham
 - One at RAL
 - 1 ready for delivery
 - 2 ready for testing
 - 2 to be finalised
 - Ready end of month
 - Control system to be ready by end of year
- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out Urgent Late
 - See talk, further questions after talk
- Barrel hybrid tendering/order Urgent In progress
 - Ash will chase Adrian
- Finalisation of barrel hybrid panel Normal Late
 - 6 hybrids successfully tested
 - Mech good
 - EDMS to be approved
 - Finish task :)
- Barrel module testframe finalisation Normal Late
 - Bart to test module in the frame
 - Hold approval for Bart’s successful test (1-2 weeks)
- Soft-/Firmware Normal Late
 - We have to improve this task, it is too undefined, skip report until task improved
 - Comment by Bruce via Email:
 - I think Matt and I tend to be more reactive about things going wrong rather than do too much planning, but would it be useful to have this as a note of what needs to be done in terms of sw/fw for module production? The major thing I know about still to be done is smoother integration with the production database. Others should feel free to comment.
- HV Tab finalisation and production Normal Late
 - Missing comments on updated HV tab version
 - Need experience using this tab
 - Prod has started
 - Finish this task and reawake if we find problems
- Supply screws and vacuum connectors Urgent In progress
 - Everything is in transit to Freiburg
 - Close task
- Supply of pins and bushings Urgent In progress
 - Craig W got component list from Marc
 - Criag W will place order ASAP, tomorrow if possible
### Quick update on UK tools and focus on database registration for tools (Sven)
- Operator needs to be careful not to slide sensor over positioning pins since they only stick out slightly from the module jig 
- Precision holes were plugged during annodisation, other holes are fully annodised
### 
### Hybrid Burn-in crate status - PB Replacement and operation with dummy loads (Ash)
- Vitaliy needs PB carrier assemblies and thinks if he can use the COTS PB from Ash instead
 - Ash thinks the COTS one cannot easily be used outside the hybrid test crate (did I get that right?)
 - The PB shortness will last through PPA
 - Rather tight for next few months, then slightly better for PPA
 - With sites not running full burn in crates we should manage
 - PPB will then see sufficient PBs (depends on when AMAC arrives, plus some time to make the 750 PBs with the new AMAC)
### AOB
- Testbeam: there is space for a DUT in the testbeam as petal is unlikely to arrive
 - Petal will very likely not be ready in time any more by this point in time
