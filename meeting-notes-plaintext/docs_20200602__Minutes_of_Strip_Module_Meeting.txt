# 02/06/20 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/874237/
## Minut es
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- Nothing
### HV tab - helper hardware (Forest)
- Seems that this could be a case of rates etc.
 - Tool can be useful if needed for throughput
 - Gluing hooks on does work if can be done in the time
 - No cases of the hook breaking before the tab
- Would be useful to understand time saving
 - Forest will do some example calculations
### Tool spares discussion (Karola)
- Should we treat different parts of the toolset differently?
 - Spare should be a full set to cover if one site goes down and need another site to cover
 - Would not want to take tools from the site that is down as that would stop them coming up and running
 - However: might make sense to have less spares for things like weights (which are not likely to get damaged) and more for stencils (which are quite likely to become unusable)
- Marc has proposed spare numbers for R0 already
 - Makes sense to look at these numbers and just mimic them?
 - Production management will update the tables based on these R0 estimates
 - Have to take into account production cluster and how we would have to redistribute tools if a site goes down
 - Dennis to add comments to R0 explaining rationale
- Will be presented next week
### Shimming (Luise)
- Be aware of HV-tab when using shims during module assembly steps
 - Can cut-out parts of the shim to avoid HV-tab, aim to just have on pedestals
- Noted that this shimming is meant to just be for now
 - For production, tools and parts should be within spec
 - Shimming in production is exceptional situation and will need to be discussed case-by-case
- Should we put shimming into the documents?
 - Given it is a get out of jail and far from the baseline, it should not go into the documents
 - Should concentrate on completing the documents for the nominal procedures, this is useful to have in our back pockets
 - Troubleshooting could go in another document or an appendix (once we have the main body of the QC documents complete)
### AoB
- None
## Actions
1. Iterate EC spares policy for discussion next week (Dennis/production management)
