Introduction
Slide 3:
- Carles: If Hysol loading works, we may not deploy these strategies? Does that mean that the loading sites are happy with this glue? Would we test it at all of the sites? It could affect things like the precision correction of the modules.
 - Luise: I’m not sure we can answer that here. All of these strategies have drawbacks and we would only do this if it was needed.
 - Carles: I’m worried we will choose to use Hysol without anyone in the EC having tried it.
 - Luise: This is more “proof of concept” at the moment
 - Sergio: We would want to build statistics before we make the decision, and cracking will be the deciding factor.
Slide 4
- Gerrit: With the modules we are building, they will never make it into the barrel. Don’t you want to have those modules into OTHER_[]?
 - Luise: we need to keep track of different performances (QC, …) and need to mark modules that are different as such (glue, glue height). For production modules, they are essentially production modules and should be counted as such. But there is nothing inherently different about them from other modules.
 - You could use the additional ending to highlight them (PRODUCTION_BNL_COLDNOISE)
 - Gerrit: (paraphrasing) Okie Dokie
- Sergio: What is the benefit of these two different stages and not all just OTHER_[]?
 - Luise: One is a stage, the other is a batch. You add the module to the stage at the beginning. You want to know if the modules are meant to be in spec (Production batch) and those that have been used for destructive purposes.
 - Sergio: Fair enough
Slide 5
- Xavi: When you say the recommendation is to apply the ion blower for only 20 seconds, is this for sensors or modules? 
 - Luise: this is mostly for modules
 - Xavi: this recommendation comes from Carles?
 - Carles: The “10 second thing” depends on the blower. It depends on the fan. The 20 seconds depends on the “gun”.
 - Xavi: for fan ion blowers we recommend minutes for sensors.
 - John: We have two cases. For every sensor measured, if the static voltage is too high, we apply the gun for 10-15 seconds. If there are interstrip problems we run it for a minute or so. It depends on distance to the sensor. We have not seen any bad behavior after using the ion blower.
 - Carles: it was the case that we had spikes in sensors and modules and we did 4min at 10cm only on strips of top segment. And it is clear that we had high noise and breakdown that comes from this segment.
 - Xavi: We usually apply the ion blower for several minutes. 
 - (Kirsten in chat: We do ~10-20 minutes on modules with this ion fan and have seen no problems: https://www.ebay.com/itm/185334574328 )
 - Carles: The gun is perpendicular to the sensor?
 - Xavi: Not exactly perpendicular, at some angle.
 - Luise: would it be possible to get the slides in the next meeting?
 - Carles agrees
 - Peter P: I think this is meaningless without a specification of distance. We have a setup at RAL running at all times some distance from the stave that will blow on the modules for weeks. So I think there is more subtlety here. It seems that putting one too close might pose a danger.
 - Luise: I will change the recommendation on the slides to reflect this and we should have some people check this (the time, distance, etc)
 - Xavi: will prepare a presentation for next week. In general in the sensor community we have not seen an issue with too long ion blower use
 - Gerrit: the ion blower fan units are used all the time with CMOS electronics and there is no problem there. Don’t think that the blowers will do any damage to our modules
 - Luise: Yes, I think this is a possibly singular instance and we will keep an eye out for it. To be followed up.
- (John in chat: These slides have some info on the ion blower setups at sensor QC sites: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1289853/contributions/5543046/attachments/2701333/4688701/FailuresAndRecoveries_EStaats_20230822.pdf )
Slide 8
- Marta: A few weeks ago, you mentioned the test frames we need to order for the EC. Are these still pending (troubles hearing Marta)
 - Luise: yes, production orders for test frames haven’t been placed. We are waiting for the prototypes from Freiburg to be released and tested before we place the order
 - Uli: Several folks are currently out sick, so I can’t comment on this.
 - Luise: As soon as we have checked these and found there is nothing

Slide X
- Alex: does the AMAC IV scan use DCDC off?
 - Cole: the test does not switch the DCDC off, but will need to check. [...]
- Alex: we just need to make sure the IVs are done with DCDC off
 - Cole: need to look to push this into the coldjiglib
 - Peter: 1366 has not been merged, but should be soon
Group Update: Scandinavia
Moved to next year
- Hannah: there was a restructuring within the cluster

No slides presented. They are attached to the agenda and were presented at the previous HV Breakdown TF meeting, please read.
Final Wrap-up of Current Measurement Issues on Some PPB Modules
Slide 16
- Forest: this table looks great, but correlation may not indicate actual causation - could there also be a correlation with the worse offset after rebonding touching the p-stop?
 - Emily: not clear
 - Forest: there seems to be such a range in the offset
 - Forest: slide 10 shows some rebonds next to the old bonds. In the documentation there are recommendations about bond placement to enable better rebond (at top or bottom of pad). Maybe it would be good to revisit bond positions to help with rebonding
- Sergio: (slide 18) in the central curve the point at 550V it looks like something is disturbing the measurement?
 - Peter: the last point is a stability measurement where you take the measurement three times and the current is falling through it
 - Sergio: we have seen that in some cases if there is a change in scale it could cause similar issues
 - Peter: there is a known issue with ill-configures Keithley 2410, but that’s not what’s on the plot here
 - Sergio: so you are well aware of the issue?
 - Peter: not aware of this if it is not the 2410
 - Sergio: it’s a 2410; should follow it up offline
 - Cole: suggest to collect all the output and then send the full output report
 - Andy: only have seen funny things with 2410 when changing the autorange.
 - Sergio: think it is related to the autorange, but will follow it offline
Results from Glue Gap Filling
- Cole: excellent job at demonstrating that this is a very unattractive option
Results from Cycling the First 3 Batches of LS Modules
Slide 11
- Tony: Cole, is the version we have different than the final version?
 - Cole: there are some minor small differences. It might just be able to write a quick script to do the changes
 - Luise: if you update ITSDAQ and do a new test, you should be able to see the differences
Slide 16
- Luise: did you try to re-take the test to ensure it is not a one-off fluctuation?
 - Alex: We have multiple warm AMAC IV tests. (ref slide 14). It was just the one warm IV that was breaking down early.
 - Tony: Vitaliy thinks there should be some smoothing of the curve. The AMAC IVs are different enough from other IVs that there needs to be some tuning [of the analysis script]
 - 
- Luise: looks like the merging works. Is there any reason to not set this up on the database?
 - Alex: it looks reasonable for me. The only issue might be that we use a slightly old merging script and some of the tests are not explicitly marked as they are called in the json file (slide 4). Might want to look into this issue.Think all data is there and can do this.
 - Luise: If you can check out the latest version and produce a new file, then we should be able to do the upload
- Tony: need to look at the IVs. Want to look at the plots on slide 17. The V6s have a bit more shape from the powerboards. It looks like a similar issue seen by the EC for the selection criteria
 - Cole: looks like we have to evaluate this criteria.
 - Tony: seems to only catch it because it’s on the edge of 
 - Luise: is this the 3.5 sigma cut for variations inside of the chip?
 - Tony: meant to catch noisy strips, but is now catching shape on module, 
 - saw it on one out of 20 modules on a warm test
 - Luise: can you pass it on to Sten and we can try to get a combined Barrel/EC overview
 - Tony: I think that’s the right thing to do.
- William: if it’s a known shape on a powerboard, yes, okay to descope, might be nice to have tests to know how far we are away from the edge
 - Tony: Speaking from experience, if a module is good, it’s good all of the time. If there is a problem, it’s often how we reference the system.
 - Luise: Just to be clear. We are not saying we should change the cuts to avoid failure. We know this is a common effect due to the PB. It’s something that should reflect an actual change.
 - William: it’s like burn-in: if we do a thousand tests and nothing fails, maybe our tests aren’t sensitive enough
 - Cole: assume we’ll nail this down with more thermal cycling data
- William (slide 9): the power supply did not see the issues with mA currents 
 - Cole: these are uA and this is on AMAC, so this is completely within spec
 - William: thought there were mA and should have been caught by the power supply
 - Tony: breakdown could be real or could not be, but if it’s breakdown, it’s linear
 - Cole: shape is a bit strange, but not too crazy
 - Tony: worth testing to see if it’s on the supply - haven’t seen anything that only goes in breakdown only when it’s cold
 - William: have seen this on some end-cap modules
 - Cole: should keep an eye on this
