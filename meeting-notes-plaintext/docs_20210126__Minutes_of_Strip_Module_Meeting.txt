https://indico.cern.ch/event/986079/
### Introduction
- ITk week agenda plan
- Please contribute to ongoing EDMS procedural doc reviews!
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R0 tool prod
 - Tools are now out for anodisation
 - One CNC machine broke delaying some of the jigs
 - Expected back in ~2 weeks, will then assemble trial parts
- R3 tools prod
 - Order is our (prev reported) and quoted delivery by first week April
 - Trying to get at least parts earlier
 - Open thing is precise metrology plan
- R5 tool prod
 - Lots of the tools in hand, doing metrology as xcheck before anodisation
 - Full set expected at end of this week
 - Send on to anodisation next week
- US Hybrid/Module tool prod
 - Slides
 - Received tooling 2 weeks ago
 - Verifying order, quick visual inspection positive
 - Sent to metrology, but proceeding slowly due to covid unavailability
 - Once metrology is done plan to 
 - Clean
 - set RFID
 - Assemble
 - register in DB
 - and send out to other institutes
- UK/China tools manufac
 - Awaiting manufacturer feedback - DELAYED
 - Craig and Sven will poke vendor
- Shipping readiness incl import etc
 - Only 3 compliance letters are missing
 - export s of ASICS
 - Are working through country list
- Barrel hybrid tendering / order Production (with ties to PPA/B)
 - Circuits are submitted (Oct) should be delivered now
 - Graphic had QC issues with thinflex and had to redo
 - 12th of Feb is new delivery date
 - Uncertainties due to covid of course
 - DuPont delivery issues remain (30+ lead time) - ne change expected
 - Surface of thinflex is different which leads to issues with solder resist mask
 - Other company changed to another solder resist, Ash is trying to see if similar step can be done at Grafic (however such changes are always rather involved, requiring re-tuning etc)
 - Will see if we can adjust contract to not include the material
- EC hybrid prod procurement
 - Received reminders from Josh and meeting on which sample to get and specs for samples
 - Will provide feedback to Josh
 - Get samples in ~4 weeks
 - Then test those samples
 - Expect invite to tender to come out this quarter
 - After invite expect 4-6 months additional wait times
- EC thermal cycle setup
 - No Sergio, will update at ITk week
- Prod R0/1/2 testframes
 - Felix- for R2
 - Wants to start beginning of March
 - First examples are produced and about to be sent (there was a QC issue)
 - R3 and R4 are awaiting results from Freiburg, will kick off order after that in Canada
- Prod of Hybrid panel cover
 - First samples look fine but use non-ESD material
 - Parts will not include press-in inserts (did not understand?), has to be done manually
 - Will not have engraved labels
 - York should seek out a different vendor for screws, should decrease price significantly
 - Sticky labels should mark which type of module the cover is for
 - Avoid stickers if possible, cut though cover to mark instead
 - Preferably remove the scratch-protection paper from cover before sending out
- EC common tools/items
 - RFIDs in population
 - Most of other things are at hand, needs to be sorted to be shipped
 - How to avoid handling fee/taxes?
 - Between 2-5k per site is material value
 - Luise & Karo will figure out and get back
 - LED strips?
 - Will take more than 2 weeks, rather 4 weeks from today
- EC Handling fame / foam / hybrid panel prod
 - Hybrid foam is cut and will be sent out with the other items above
 - Module foam is test cut and will be final cut once test frames are there
 - Is fast work though
### Quote for making dummy glass sensors
- R4 by Luise & Co
- R5 by Dordmund
- R3 maybe by William an Co
- Might want to adjust geometry a bit (making the sensor slightly smaller to allow loading tests as well) → postponed for later
### Tool metrology
- Will be checked for every single part: planarity, parallelism, distance plane to plane
- Will check pin hole diameter by inserting bushings / trying out with positioning pins
- Will check ASIC pocket by trying out with ASICs. Visual inspection to look for burrs.
- Finding hole centre is more reliable, so will measure relative distances (if hard, still need to measure). Center of holes where the hybrid/sensor positioning pins can’t be checked by placing the pickup tool, need to try to measure their position by vision means of the vision machine.
- Upload to DB will be sorted
### Hybrids and modules in the database
- No comments
### AOB
- None
