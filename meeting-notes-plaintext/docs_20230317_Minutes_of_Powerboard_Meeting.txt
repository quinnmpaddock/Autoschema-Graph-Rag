# 17/03/2023 - Minutes of Powerboard Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260564/
- Instructions for notes: only cover major decisions, not all minor details.
### What we know
Luise: 4 main questions to discuss today:
1. Change barrel PB Bill of Materials (BOM)?
1. Schedule to populate current barrel PB flexes
1. Longer term: change barrel PB flexes?
1. Schedule for that
- Use of capacitors on stilts: in general, they are difficult to solder by hand, as the legs are soldered onto the capacitors and also melt. Using reflow seems best. 
- Send some to Penn to try out soldering there
- Plan for first 2000 powerboards:
 - After discussion: populate all 2000 as initially planned, but leave the shieldbox off of 150 boards.
 - We also discussed though: [Jaya John is not sure if these 2 ideas are abandoned?]
 - Let’s find out if we can assemble, at Epic, ~100 boards with alternative capacitors
 - Will require to replace all capacitors of the same type
 - Keep some unpopulated in case of further changes we want to try?
- No clear replacement for the reverse-geometry capacitors
- Plan to evaluate PBs with capacitors on stilts:
 - Make some PBs with capacitors on stilts
 - Get to SCIPP to build onto some SS modules, to test for cold noise
- 
- As info: the PB contract is structured as 2000 + 12000. 
 - This contract for 14000 is already signed. The only option so far is to have a gap after the first 2000.
 - The contract assumes no changes to the design after the first 2000. 
 - Lead time for flexes: 7 working weeks + 1 week shipping + 1 week QC.
### Flex questions
- 3.0a don’t see cold noise
 - This had through-vias on all 4 layers.
 - Reverse-geometry capacitor is rotated compared to all the other versions. 
 - It has much less copper than later versions.
 - There are potential glue differences as well, being tracked down. RAL transitioned from using Polaris in Bi-packs to Polaris from bottles at some point, which probably increases the crystallisation of the glue. 
- 3.0b and c do see cold noise
- 3.1 seems to have even more cold noise
- Capacitor choices: might be worth calling Murata and asking for help
- Via discussion:
 - Staggered vias don’t seem to be the solution for cold noise (Dennis and Peter)
- EC powerboards have cover layer and solder mask at bottom (for stiffness)
 - Discussed trying a small batch with cover layer and solder mask added, or stiffeners
- We will make comparative laser vibrometer measurements of endcap powerboards.
- Do we want to make a small barrel PB batch at Würth as a comparison? 
 - Sounds feasible. 
 - Do we want to change the feed-through capacitor in parallel?
- Three paths to pursue:
 - Add stiffener to powerboard
 - Make barrel powerboard from Wuerth
 - Try change of feed through capacitor
- Measure the stiffness of barrel PBs and endcap PBs.
 - Send some endcap PBs to Timon for this.
- Penn has offered Godwin’s help in making modifications to powerboards.
