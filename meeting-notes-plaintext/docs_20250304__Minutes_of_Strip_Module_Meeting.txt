# 2025-03-04 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1513180/
### Introduction
Presenter: Navid Ghorbanian
- William: what is this looking into module building? What is the existing spec?
 - Navid: Yes just module building we will discuss this next week
- Luise: can we see what has been discussed already in the UK national meetings
### L4 Updates:
### Group Update: Glasgow & Birmingham
Presenter: Katie Walkingshaw Pass 
For Glasgow: 
- Vitaly: For the unusual IVs you could try to change the module frames
 - Kaite: we’ll give that a go
- Peter: I have your comment about lower suction cup noise, that interesting we are doing the same thing with nitrogen. We have also had to treat all the last lot of Glasgow modules for suction cup noise
 - Andy: going theory is that that the shipping can cause rubbing of the suction cups on the sensor that leads to suction cup noise
 - Bart said something that I completely missed 
- Theo (via chat): we store in dry nitrogen, but ship with dried atmos air, yet still see SCN
 - Bart (via chat): Yes but you do pack it with silica gel (and under ‘vacuum’?) which all makes it very dry.
 - Peter (via chat): I haven't checked for a week or so, but I think it is still true that the "sensor recovery" test can only be applied to the sensor ID. Which means that we should either be recording module recovery as sensor recovery, or we should add the sensor recovery "test" to modules as well.
 - Carles (via chat): the second one makes more sense
 - Vitaliy (via chat): There is a module recovery test in DB as well.
 - Carles (via chat): I see it, great 
 - Theo (via chat): silica yes, vacuum no
 - Peter (via chat): Thanks Vitaliy, Was this recently added or did I just miss it last time? Never mind. Does anyone have a json example for this test? in particular examples for what to put for method (deionisation?), the rest I can probably guess from the dto sample
 - Luise (via Chat): I don't have a json, but if you look at slide 15 of the introduction today, it shows what to enter in the free text field :)
 - Carles (via chat): Isn't the "DTO example" in the test what you want? [and then pasted the json–]

 - Peter (via chat): Carles, I'm asking primarily for examples of "method". the rest I can get from dto pas I say above
 - Vitaliy (via chat): From the sensor/module IV document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k9_-offb1-2i5_SuCb1c6F88cK48cS9bQOVBT64ROwQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.1sa1dkhjrwds ): Recovery attempts should be uploaded using the test “ATLAS18_RECOVERY_V1” and using one of the following methods:
baking, uv irradiation, dry storage, long term hv, repeat iv, plasma cleaning, de-ionization
• Please, provide the reason for recovery
• The time stamp (and run number) for each test is important to understand the chronology of the tests and recoveries
▪️ Reporting tools can be used to extract conclusions when all this information is uploaded correctly to the DB
 - Peter (via chat): Thanks, Vitaliy! 
 - Peter (via chat): I note it's the US spelling of deionization, not the UK one (deionisation). I am absolutely bound to get that wrong at some point...
 - Vitaliy (via chat): Well, it should probably be done through a script, that can either 1) present the user with a selectable option, or 2) check the inputs. That's how I think about it, anyway..
 - 
- Lusie: Are you okay with dicing the mini sensors yourself? We can involve another institute?
 - Andy: I’m not sure we can do them all
 - Luise: we can help
 - Andy: okay I’ll see what we have done already
For Birmingham: 
- William: Does anybody know about the UK DHL? Are these things in pelican cases? 
 - Andy: Usually shipped via DHL in the usual packaging. Recent parcels with all the packaging seem to have been treated worse over the last 6 months, treated more roughly, than before.
 - Peter: The last three from Glasgow were properly packed, and two were rotated and some had screws fallen out. Not sure how that has happened 
 - William: Must be something local…doesn’t happen at the airports apparently
### QT Update: HCC Timing Studies
Presenter: Lukas Roscher
- Cole: does this change the delay settings on the fly or just the start
 - Lukas: No, changes everything on the fly. 
 - Cole: Oh, excellent! We may want a stripped-down version so that it doesn’t take 30-seconds per hybrid for use on staves/petals (would be 30 minutes on a short strip stave…) 
 - Lukas: At the moment it could be shorter, the main loop in the scan is producing alot of debugging. If the logic changes it could even be a bit faster. 
- Alex: I’m very interested. We have a lot of issues with this. I couldn’t access your GitLab link. Is it possible for other sites to try this right now? Is it in a condition where that makes sense? 
 - Lukas: At the moment I wouldn’t. We see these timeout issues. In 1 or two weeks we will have fixed some of the issues and it might make sense
- Alex: which settings exactly are you scanning?
 - Lukas: The BC delay the LCB delay the RClk delay and the PRLP delay (page2) These are the four that are usually scanned in the comms test 
 - Alex: Is this O-phase default value typically in there? 
 - Lukas: we have talked about it it is a interesting thing whether it is necessary or not but we need to understand if we need it or not. 
 - Alex: OK, sometimes we also had to change that for different modules 
 - Lukas: Yes, might be interesting to extending to include that. We have to look at the feasibility. 
- Lukas: for the git I thought it should be available but im not sure will have another look.
- William: Thanks for this It’s nice to see. S5, right hand plot – I guess this goes to one of your middle bullets in your conclusion where you’re wondering why these gaps/glitches open up? Is there any understanding? 
 - Bruce: right hand plot? 
 - William: yes
 - Bruce: the important thing about the right hand plot is something to do with delays
 - William: That’s the kind of thing I’m interested to know. Should we just be in the middle of the islands, or try to stay systematically away? I guess stay tuned for the further studies 
 - Lukas: yes this is good to try get the first working version 
 - William: Sometimes you get time-outs or things that fail. But no, OK, you’re on the right track. Thanks 
- Luise: Looks great, We are currently not storing the settings in the scans, could we set this up in the DB json files. Then we can easily check the test settings in the DB?
 - Bruce: We need to discuss what we’re doing. I’ve been trying to set up a digital tests “test” using the current digital tests so we can put it in the database. We need to work out how to integrate different things. That is still a goal. 
 - Luise: thank you 
### AOB
- Tony: can I confirm the sequence for the hybrid burn-in? 
 - Cole: 24 hours
 - Peter: hold on are you sure at the last test we said 20 tests
 - Cole: I think we said 20 hours but both is fine
 - Peter: the none gui does 20 tests the GUI still does 24 hours
 - Cole: I will follow up with Ben but we should make this consistent.
- Tony: do we have to do any tests past this? We are assuming we have to just do 20
 - Cole: Yes
