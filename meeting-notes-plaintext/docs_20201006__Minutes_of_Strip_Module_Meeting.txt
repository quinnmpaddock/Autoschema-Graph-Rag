# 06/10/20 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/927522/
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- Some EDMS reviews are about to start
- 
### Task tracker items
- Please see task tracker web page: 	https://indico.cern.ch/event/927522/contributions/4052501/attachments/2116697/3561815/go
- test frame finalisation (EC hybrid, EC module, B hybrid, B module)
 - B module is effectively ready, B hybrid very nearly ready
 - EC hybrid / module now on EDMS
 - We will email Kambiz and confirm, report by date to next week, then kick off EDMS review as soon as we have confirmation from Kambiz
 - Luise: K wanted to get R1 reviewed first taking HV re-routing as focus
- EC hybrid review
 - Effectively complete, will mark as approved and task tracker item as complete
 - Order to go out very soon for PPA
- EC tool review
 - complete, will mark as approved and task tracker item as complete
- EC tool production
 - Move report date to in 2 weeks
 - Please look at technical drawings for R4
- EC PPA hybrid order
 - Move Report by date in 3 weeks
- Barrel hybrid tendering
 - Move Report by date in 3 weeks
 - Change label to “order”
 - Ash got more and more Du Pont material warnings, so go for thinflex for coming order and qualify new material
 - Do not need full irrad quali as material was tested for irrad beforehand
 - Graphic expressed interest and will come up with quote soon
- EC hyb/PB tendering
 - Move Report by date Nov 3rd
- Multi / Single module transport box finalisation
 - Report date to in Oct 27th
 - Frames arrived in the US (BNL) and will be looked at asap, should work with in 3 weeks
- Cold setups (all)
 - Move report by date to end Oct / beginning Nov
- FW/SW
 - In 4 weeks
- HV Tab
 - Next week
- EC single module transport box
 - No update, report date to 27/10
 - For production then
 - Foam from Freiburg
 - Plexi from Berlin
 - Will create new task for production
- QC Docs
 - About to move many to EDMS
 - Few remain with open ends, Craig W on top of things, will get onto it once he is back
### HV Tab test pulling
- Simon pulled at right angle and sees >100g pull forces
- Forest pulled along tab and saw >500g pull forces
- 90 degrees is more of a peel test
- Along tab is more of a shear test
- CraigS: Expected stress is going to be more shear than peel from CTE mismatches during or after cool-down
 - Carl: module could locally pop off of the SE4445 which could lead also to a peel component
 - CraigS: yes however due to flatness spec of the module this should be max 100micrometers so it should be small
 - Adhesive that held the tab locally could break this
 - We should try to do a calculation of what we expect
 - Vitaliy did that, and found around 440g, which is a bit close to the 500g. Cold test with a mockup was done (8 HV tabs on half moon with even harsher CTE mismatch and found all tabs survived
- Much discussion… result: 
 - might be good to add wriggle to HV tab when installing on core. Method to do so open
 - Will be good to see results for more realistic setups (bond to sensor backplane on one side and core on other or core-2-core as worst case then thermal cycle
### Suction cups
- Agreement that nitrile was not the way to go
- Some worry in the US about the manufacturing quality of the suction cups
 - Not seen in the UK supply
- Worries about AS material left on sensor (either residue or from imperfections in manufacture)
- Equally well, AS is the “correct” way to go
 - Need to confirm whether it causes any noise issues
- Regarding experience with AS suction cups “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it...”?
- To be revisited next week...
### EC hybrid panel transport frame
- Drop cover at back of hybrid transport “box”?
 - Should be ok, Marc will check with Kambiz
 - If Kambiz is ok with shipping without back-cover we will drop it
 - Marc will report back to Karo if this can be dropped from the list of required purchases
- Marc will also ask Kambiz if frames/panels are final so that we can start EDMS review
### AOB
