# 06/12/2022 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1191867/
### Introduction
Slide 3
- No objections to set automatically
Slide 4
- Tony: 5 modules tried with added capacitors and all show cold noise
- Ashley: interesting to see a module from a stave
- Ashley: agree that other sites haven’t seen it (also with number of bias bonds)
- Ashley: might send our module to RAL/Birmingham for test
### Institute Contributions
Lund
- Ingo: for vacuum sealer, maybe use the normal vacuum and just heat-seal the bag.
- Theo: we have something like a kitchen sealer
- Bart: just make sure you get enough heat to seal the moisture barrier bags
Next week: TRIUMF
### Interference of PB pickup tool with PB SMD components
- William: see one or two cases where removing the pins helps, but in other cases where the pins are too far away and issues occur because powerboards are too curvy. We will not get 50um precision with this type of circuit and don’t get enough support for wire-bonding
 - Peter: have added some glue therefore it starts to squeeze out
 - William: this seems to be the right way to go
 - Peter: haven’t tried to pick-up a powerboard without this pin. I’m concerned about the force of the vacuum suction cups

### IV scan behaviour change proposals
- Vitaliy: 20uA comes from an ATLAS specification. It is not considered dangerously high if it is only for a brief time. A ramp down is required when this is reached. IV is to find the breakdown so that we can stay clear of the breakdown regime
 - Vitaliy: if the IV software does not ramp down, that is not good
 - Theo: there is currently nothing in the documentation that required reamdown when breakdown current is reached
 - Vitaliy: there is in a table, but not for module tests (it is for IV tests)
 - Vitaliy: ITSDAQ should be compliant and ramp down when high current is reached
 - Andy: 20uA is this when the module is fully biased for an IV. Is there a recommendation for module operation at full bias?
 - Vitaliy: when you power through the powerboard, there is a 10MOhm resistor, so the 20uA does not work. Guideline is using an additional current on top of what the resistor consumes.
 - Andy: ITSDAQ appends 20uA to the resistor value. When we get to 500V, is there a number for a maximum current that we should run a module at?
 - Vitaliy: it should be OK to add 20uA to the powerboard (it is too much for a bare sensor)
 - Andy: only done for module with powerboard
 - Andy: what should be the maximum current at full operation?
 - Vitaliy: different questions, one is for IV the other for module operation. There should be some reasonable automatic ramp-down and interlock but that is a different question
- Vitaliy: for difference between target and measured, noticed this but it was always small. Never have seen the case where the breakdown was falsely set to a lower voltage
 - Tony: if it is in breakdown and stays in breakdown, the voltage could go down. The point is that if breakdown is reached, the voltage should be ramped down.
- William: the 75uA for a module with powerboard (for R3 we need 130uA) there can be 5-10uA more from resistor. Need this 20uA to account for resistor value variations. The question is also what the power supply is doing (it is set to 130uA, not just the 20uA)
 - Theo: 20uA is the bare sensor compliance, then you add for the powerboard resistor. We might need an additional x% to compensate for resistor value uncertainties. 
 - Tony: for the analysis code, should you not just use the set value. And as soon as you see a value that is below that, the run should be abortet. It should be impossible to have a lower voltage step in a ramp-up program
 - Theo: analysis happens after the measurement (offline).
 - Tony: but the measurement should not record a value that is below target and just stop (if within a certain target value).
 - Theo: how do you perform IV scans when the module hits compliance?
 - Tony: you should not go above the breakdown voltage.
 - Bart: this is a good idea
 - Theo: ITSDAQ will take a measurement point at the value where it breaks down.
 - Tony: you take points every 10V. Don’t know of any breakdown where it happens within 10V
 - Vitaliy: you don’t get 20uA jumps within a small voltage range. 
 - Theo: we don't have data where this has happened.
 - Tony: if compliance is reached, the system should ramp down immediately
 - Bart: this is done in Labview (reading compliance flag from power supply), but ITSDAQ continues reading values when compliance is reached
 - Tony: and throw out the value when reaching compliance
 - Theo: but then this would require a change in ITSDAQ and LabVIEW
 - Bart: there is an absolute 20uA current limit, but sensors are better than that (200nA) a smaller level will catch a breakdown
 - Christoph: LabVIEW does not only have a hardware compliance, but there is also a field for a software compliance. Could set the hardware compliance to 20uA and set the software compliance to a lower value to stop the measurement at a reasonable time.
 - Vitaliy: there are a few sensors in the uA current range
- Andy: have we written down a value for a good operation current of a module.
 - Vitaliy: not to my knowledge
 - Andy: so we would need a table for this, also for staves and integration
- Theo: happy with 20uA for a hardware compliance, and use a lower value for the software compliance
 - Vitaliy: just be careful to set it to a fixed value since there are uA current sensors
- Theo: do want an automated ramp-down
- Theo: for database, what should be save?
 - Vitaliy: difference is infinitesimal
 - Bart: just important where the breakdown happened
 - Theo: so record target voltage
### RFID on Endcap Hybrids
- Ingo: does this work in linux?
 - Julian: tried on various machines (also Windows). It uses pyQT5 and pySerial but then should be fine
### SE4445 Instructions
- Peter: how long after gluing do you see the capillary effect?
 - Matt: don’t remember. Probably relatively quickly
 - Peter: have done spot checks on sensor and saw this within minutes
- Peter: when mixing by hand in plastic boats, I noticed it to be quite abrasive against the boats. Maybe have to find a different mixing container
 - Dennis: it will abrate everything since it is aluminium oxide
 - Matt: is the concern that the material from the container will change the glue properties?
 - Yes
- Vitaliy: we have also seen the streaks.
- Vitaliy: do the streaks to to the region of the bondpads, or on top of them?
 - Matt: the go to the bondpads
 - Vitaliy: to the go onto the pads? In past we dis see the glue but it was on the sides of the pads, not directly on top of them
 - Matt: that would make sense. We have seen the lines go past the bondpads, but didn’t check the pads directly
- Theo: on slide 2, are these the shipping container?
 - Matt: no, it comes in a container that can go into a mixer. We decant it into a different container
 - Theo: can it be used in a syringe?
 - Matt: a syringe is used to glue module onto a stave
 - Theo: we just pull the glue into a syringe an weigh the syringe. But that only works for glue that is not too viscous
 - Matt: we also use syringe to decant the glue and to place it into the mixing boat
