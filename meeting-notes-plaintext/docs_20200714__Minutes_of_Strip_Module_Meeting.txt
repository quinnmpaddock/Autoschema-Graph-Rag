# 14/07/20 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/927510/
## Minutes
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- An ITk-wide task tracker is becoming available (hosted at CERN), for the module group this would include tasks such as jiig production, hybrid design, tendering, cold jig roll-out etc.
 - Each task will have connected responsible institutes/people
 - Completion date and “next update” date will be included and used to track tasks
 - Will be careful that updates on these tasks does not take over whole meeting but will need to find a balance
- The statusing process for the last three months is complete
 - In discussion with PMO to allow everyone to see the schedule including “summary views” which allow people to easily see the important milestones
 - Watch this space!
- Float from ~100 days reduced by 60 days, certain groups have accumulated way more delay than that, how does that fit together?
 - Not all items that were delayed are on critical path
 - For example: sensors are still arriving (even though testing might be delayed)
- We know not all sites will be ready for qualification in time, but that’s not fully encoded in the schedule at this point
- Craig will show review milestones/schedule next week so people can get a better idea of how realistic current goals are
### EDMS (Craig)
- No comments
### EC tooling discussion (Marc, Tynan, Pablo & William)
- Have pins been ordered already?
 - Marc is waiting for a final decision, stopped all purchasing plans until then
- Comment: designs online since June, not much time for review
 - Note designs for R0 toolset have been online for much longer
 - Marc asked for comments and a review of them multiple times and only very few people reacted (need increased EDMS involvement from the community!) 
- Reviewing new changes could take longer than just one or two weeks, how much time for EDMS review?
 - Significant changes will need longer (2+ weeks) than minor (1 week)
 - These times may be optimistic as may be delayed if we have to spend lots of time chasing people for approvals
- Tricky to say when pre-production A starts exactly, general plan was when ABCstar ASICs come back (diced ASICs expected beginning of September!)
 - In January pre-production B should start (defined by when tendered hybrids and HCCStar/AMAC arrive)
 - Particularly tricky for endcap since no star modules have been built yet!!
 - After tools are available, probably need at least a month to get used to them and make prototypes 
 - Safest thing (in terms of schedule) would be to get EDMS review done with pins and slotted holes (no bushings) 
 - At same time test bushings and get them fitted afterwards, but this would lead to a loss in precision according to spanish company
- Important to understand timing of different plans
- Question: do we take risk to spend more money now to test out different plans or try out one plan that might then cost us time because it doesn’t work 
- Endcap has way fewer uses than barrel (since fewer modules per type build at each site)
- Main worry schedule, not money → strongly in favour of kicking off as quickly as possible by approving drawings and get them out for manufacture with pin solution and relaxed tolerances and see if it works. 
 - If it doesn’t work bushings can get brought into the game if necessary
 - Modification of adding bushing would require tools to get taken away from sites which would stop any production as well
 - Expectation is that pins and holes/slots will work but wear is the main worry
- Changes in tolerances don’t need to get changed in the solid model, is only attached to drawing in separate information sheet
- Harder anodization helps because even if you have to re-ream the hole you don’t get down to the bare aluminium (50 um anodisation layer)
 - Also matches experience from the past which were generally not hard anodised
- To end discussion:	
 - Driving issues are schedule items 
 - Have to push through getting manufacturing started with standard pin solution based on current drawings
 - To get approved in the next week or so
 - Marc will have to replace some drawings that already got small modifications in that case
 - Craig will end current approval process
 - New review with one week deadline will get started once updated models uploaded
 - After that: push out to manufacture
 - In parallel look into bushing solution
- If that’s the way we want to go we will have to continue the order of pins
- Where in the timeline would people have time to make 2D drawings with tolerances? When would that be reviewed?
 - All models have gone through EDMS review before, 2D drawings should be started right away (aka now)
 - If no significant comments are made for 3D drawings, kick off 2D drawing review immediately after 3D review is finished
 - Give another week then for the review of the 2D drawings 
- To sum up: after Marc has uploaded version of drawings we want to go with:
 - One week to review 3D drawings (review completion targeting 24th July)
 - Start 2D drawings in parallel
 - Start 2D drawing review as soon ad 3D review is done
 - Finish that review after a week (review completion targeting 31st July, 7th August may be more realistic)
 - WILL NEED QUICK RESPONSES ON EDMS - THE MORE CRAIG/INGO HAVE TO CHASE, THE MORE DELAY THIS WILL INCUR!!!
 - Get first tools to all groups by mid-September (assuming 4-6 week production)
 - This still may be quite optimistic if we don’t push quickly
 - Bushes to be investigated in parallel as backup solution
 - Discussion towards end of the year about whether to continue with preproduction tools through production
 - Rework or new tools with bushings or keep as is to be discussed
### Practical EC tooling review (Carles & Pablo)
- Timeline less optimistic compared to Craig’s 
- Company assumes tools could be done by November
- Seems matching with Toronto’s timeline where full tool production could take ~1-2 months according to first quotes
- Zeuthen technician ran into the same problem, would prefer the 90 degree connectors as well
 - Preference because they use glue robot
 - DESY HH uses same robot and does not see any problems
 - Ingo therefore withdraws his comment
 - Will discuss offline to come to a final conclusion
- Can this be modified easily in drawings?
 - Marc will need dimensions for this, but in principle it can be done
 - Will discuss offline
 - Will be changed for all tools
- Why are straight ones preferable?
 - With 90 degree one the tube is getting pretty close to the hybrid/power board
### AoB
- Barrel transport boxes?
 - Did we decide to go into production? Yes, Hongbo has put out order (~40 days until delivery)
- Will ping company for dummy hybrid order (EC) to see if we can get delivery update
