##### QC groups
- (Tony) should we add a hybrid/module assembly group to the list
- (Craig) to be added to this in 3 months or so - powerboard mass tester, module thermal cycling setup, hybrid crate setup
### Hybrid crate status (Ash)
- (Craig) should do the same on FMC-DP - bit trickier due to output buffers
- (Vitaliy) what is your scope bandwidth (1 GHz) so could make interpretation tricky
- (Vitaliy) could try back termination? It’s already there…
