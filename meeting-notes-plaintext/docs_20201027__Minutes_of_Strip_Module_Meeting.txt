 - Should have review? Probably since first design was rejected by community
 - Any shipping tests done? No, but no different results expected compared to initial design
 - Video shows boxes that are not wrapped in ESD bags and has shock sensors attached, this is where problems arose in the past
 - Have to do this test!
 - Question: no x-y restriction in new design, wouldn’t that pose a risk? Christian was trying to get the modules to move by dropping etc but so far no problem seen
 - Could add more foam to both sides of the modules, would increase price but could be done if we see problem

 - Basically final, will discuss internally in the Uk if it can be marked as done
### EC testing frames
- Result of discussion:
 - Changing blind via to through vias is accepted
 - Covering the back with a solder mask is not recommended for thermal reasons
### Documentation status / plans for the EDMS reviews
- Readiness is better than 50%
- Keep xxx for EC hybrid thickness throughout review and fill correct number once we know EC hybrid producer
 - Keep a list of things that are unknown so far
### Single module testing at LBNL
- Is there a connection to earth somewhere in the setup? 
 - Not clear
- Might need proper ground connection for Nexys to improve results (as shown in testbeam)
- Craig to try and draw sketch of best practise connection
- How was glue applied? Stencil, want to switch to robot for production, not yet done 
- Should ground chuck to frame because it’s known to help with noise
- Have to add recommendations for best practice to electrical testing QC document
