# 2024-05-30 - Minutes of Interposer technical discussion
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1420622/
### Introduction
- Follow-ups from last week:
- SCIPP: tests for low coverage
- Tom: glass bead usage 
- Tom: instructions for powerboard alignment
- Loading sites: plenty of expired SE4445, which is probably still good to use
 - Viscosity change observed, i.e. problematic for dispensing methods relying on viscosity
 - SE4445 found to be usable even three years after expiration, if components are mixed well
 - Question from Vitaliy: Source? 
 - Luise: loading sites gave input. They do see viscosity changes.
 - Vitaliy: Is there a study with this data
 - Luise: Yes. No proper study, hope we can do one
#### US Updates:
- Anne: continuing interposing single powerboard effort
 - Investigating options to maintain holes in powerboards to be used for alignment
 - Luise: any news from Amtech discussions?
 - Anne: getting quotes from Amtech to get the SMD populated arrays out of Amtech, then need to sort out process on LBL side
#### UK/C Updates:
Contribution from Karol Krizka
- Karol: do we think the glue oozing out is a problem?
 - Luise: we don’t quite know - would be good to know if it impacts adhesion to True Blue, and we don’t know what happens if it goes onto the sensor - SE4445 on the sensor causes early breakdown, but we don’t know if that is the glue or if the oozing out can cause the same problem
 - Sandra: Tom has seen something similar, it oozes out, but he usually just cleans it up - it’s easy to remove (the glue)
 - Sven: did you see the residue only on the interposer or also on the flex?
 - Sandra: only on the interposer
- Follow up: does SE4445 residue on bond pads a cause bonding problems,
- Follow up: does SE4445 residue on interposer cause adhesion problems
- Aluminum plates too soft on the book press?
 - Karol: Need custom centre inserts anyway
 - Bart: significant impact on cost
- Bart: RAL continuing at pace (see update from Tuesday), 
 - Liverpool also continuing tests
 - Birmingham shown today
 - shear/peel tests need glue mixer (outgassing) to prevent variability in results, hoping to get mixer like Dennis’
#### End-cap Updates:
- Luise: use design for R0, R3 hybrids?
 - Ben: working on making these designs as well
 - Pete: excellent, if you have stencil designs, we can try
 - Ben: dxf okay?
 - Pete: perfect
#### Database setup:
- Theo: interposer child is a dummy or a real object?
 - Luise: Populate with a dummy, in future attach to arrays anyway
- No objections against starting like that and refine further when needed
#### Any other Business
- Karol: has anyone checked what happens if you try to attach True Blue to SE4445 without an additional interposer?
 - Anne: they just didn’t stick very well
 - Karol: we tried to just attach a blob of SE4445 to a blob of True Blue and they stuck like normal
 - Tom: we stenciled SE4445 onto True Blue and the SE4445 basically just contracted - no wetting, surface tension was terrible
 - Karol: we used big blobs, so different situation
 - Tom: don’t have a picture, but wouldn’t be hard to recreate
- Bart: glass beads used successfully in US in other contexts but UK doesn’t have this context, would be nice to see the application where it was used in-detector successfully to resolve argument where UK doesn’t see necessity
 - Tom: we’ve been using it extensively on pixels, there is a presentation from SLAC, will dig that up
 - Bart: that would be amazing! Would be good to see for which applications it is useful
- Luise: residue affecting adhesion or bondability- anyone planning to look into these?
 - Bart: willing but has to come out of something else. Should solve this with the engineering of process
 - Sandra: what kind of test proposing? Deliberately make samples with contamination?
 - Luise: yes put SE4445 on bond pads
 - Tom: cover bond pads, pull SE4445 off them, then wirebond (worst case)
 - Luise: put around bond pads then let creep, but more reliably put directly on bond pads as long as can clean off the SE4445 itself
 - Kirsten: can we agree on whether to clean the pad or not?
 - Kirsten: If doesn’t bond, clean with IPA and try again
 - Luise: Second step of the test
 - LBL will do these tests
- Bart: suggest topical meeting. SE4445 behavior- adhesion to different surfaces, pressure required different for Al, kapton
 - Luise: after ITk week specific meeting for adhesion
- Bart: need to agree on a QA/QC programme
 - Luise: discussion at ITk Week
Next Interposer meeting will be a topical meeting: surface preparation and adhesion
