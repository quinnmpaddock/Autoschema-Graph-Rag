https://indico.cern.ch/event/1289849/
### ITSDAQ news
- No slides, lots of updates ongoing
- Few bugs, 
 - Wait till next week to update to ITSDAQ (hv mapping)
 - AMAC IV will work but may be error
 - If seen please contact the experts
- Next week will show how autoconfig works
- Ben - tested this, works very well thanks. Is AC ready to be added to burn in GUI yet? Most things work well for the barrel, but a mix of endcap types is causing issues. Need to test it out Peter and Bruce will be able to answer more on the use for burn in
- Will - Does it use the fuse ids or reading the DB records?
- Cole - It reads the DB, but doesn’t create
- Tony - From the intro, F/W is being recommended. Should we do this?
- Cole - Definitely recommend to do this
- Cole - For 4 R3 in the box issue, there are no specific port requirements with FMC DP. Didn't need the update on the software but just correct CCR codes
- Will - We got it to work. Thanks to all those involved
### Institute Contributions: Celestica
Slides on Electrical Testing:
- Cole in chat: ‘I think that is the FMC-DP ADC Calibration’
- Vitaliy
 - ET readout, except for 1 module others are happy. Ddi you look at the number of bad cons channels? For all of them
 - No
 - I think it would be good to do 
 - slide 6 you are showing good module but not clear if it’s really good
 - On slide 4, on RHS youtube R3029? Current looks really low
 - Scales in microamps, others are different
 - Showed data at FT, then some at cold. Were others done cold?
 - No
 - My hypothesis that when IV are dont cold breakdown can change exp with ones with glue on guard ring
 - To clarify 4 of 13 definitely have, some may but no sure
 - On slide 15, different currents when cold, think the rough about is 0 because its cold. If you measure something it indicates something
 - Tony it could be an artefact of the AMAC current?
 - Craig - Can't trust the 0’s but maybe the relative 0’s
 - Craig - Looks like the contact is opening and closing at different temperatures
 - Vitality only if sensor is high when cold
 - Will - we have poked at the HV tab for disconnection but we don’t say anything
 - If HV off when no more than 2000e noise?
 - Tony - Did you test? I thought it was 
 - Will thought it was 15,000
 - How is the HV Bond on? Tab bonded to the sensor
 - Tony - Not sure if 0V is different for disconnected for noise
 - Will we can try to set to 0 and check the noise
 - Vitaliy - may have a point. Disconnected will have 0,3v as a built in bias
 - How are the HV tabs connected to the frame? 3 bonds to each 
 - Look at both sides of the wb for the hv tabs
 - Will - Does this explain JJ results (slide 12)
 - Cole - Not sure, looks like 2 instance of ITSDAQ talking and 1 is not calibrated
 - Craig - Can look at the ITSDAQ root files scan by scan and see if there is anything funky going on 
 - Tony - Bart has plots like this. Anyone else?
 - Tony - if this is HV on and off, it will eventually break the sensors
 - Craig - on slide 8, Bottom RIght CCR 1 is port 1-2 CCR2 is port 3-5
 - 
### Post-cracking module inspection
- Tony - Glue layer was purposely made 20um thicker
- No Questions
### Barrel (Bare) Hybrid Flex QC
- Sandra - we also found in the US, exp for pull test, with high failure. Ageing tests o the same that failed we get 50% fails
 - Sven - Only want to focus on VI issues
 - Yes but we see correlation with pull test and visual issues
 - Oth
- Sandra: some defects are really hard to see. If we change the classification, might have to re-do the inspection. Did not see this before
 - Ashley: have been back in touch with manufacturer and wait for their QC report about failure
 - Ashley: most recent batch received last week was good (similar to received circuits in the past). Hope that things are back on track [since they restarted production]
 - Sandra: that is the hope we all have
- William: haven’t seen barrel coupons, but Freiburg has done a good job in weeding out issues
 - Sven: currently not have the equipment at Liverpool to do images of each defect, but will be recorded in database
 - William: hard to do the re-alignment in the wire bonder, second Sandras comment about better
- Vitaliy: how do you do the adjustment
 - Sven: easy to do
 - Tony: can be done, but how do you record this
 - Sven: can’t do notification of single wire numbers
 - William: can you just take them aside?
 - Sven: yes, but then we will run out of circuits
 - Tony: it depends on number of circuits and how much time it takes to modify the bond programs
 - Ashely: see what the next batches will be like, but have concern that the 1% defect rate is beyond the manufacturer capability. Randomly distributed issues and keep a unique log of that. At moment don’t see a reason to bin them, they are usable and just require a bit more effort for the wire-bonding
 - Tony: depends on the price of a single circuit
 - Ashley: while we are not at full production rate, we have to see where it goes. Concern is that we pick up issues that we have not reported in the past.
 - Forest: if it is visible on bonder, we avoid this.
 - Forest: we scan through chip positions and wires and avoid visible issues (can’t guarantee that we get all)
 - Ashley: that is similar to what we do here
 - Ashley: issues during pre-production were minimal
- Forest: need to maintain some level of feedback to manufacturer
 - Forest: for single point pads with plating holes, would be worried about bonding to something that has a defect that could potentially get worse with time
 - Forest: for things that are easily cleaned, hope that this is caught by distribution site and need a mechanism on who is doing the cleaning
 - Forest: it takes more time or more cost, there will be some defects no matter what. We probably have to do some inspection.
 - Forest: for logging, agreeing with taking pictures and interfacing with databases is not easy. Need a simple text code on how to get the information to the wire bonder (we have a paper traveller where issues for the wire-bonder are noted [wire numbers] ).
 - Hybrid Number, chip number, row number, right middle left
 - Forest: need to find a way on how to get data to everyone
 - Sven: can get overview
 - Sven: can highlight the hybrids with issues by putting a permanent-marker dot on the tab with the pull test area
 - Sven: can mark holes on single pads as fail if holes have significant size
 - Forest: will send an example on how we do this. Would be good to have a diagram no how to do the numbering
- Kirsten: for tracking things, if a blob is spotted and passed with problems and then passed to hybrid assembly site; would like to have some kind of physical marker 
### Introduction
Slide 
- No comments
### AOB
- Marcus gives a very quick update on burn-in
 - Merging script would fail summary test when a single burn-in test failed for whatever reason (e.g. a blip)
 - Made an update in the script for this on the pass/fail criteria of the burn-in test
 - If other people see this (from running Mo’s merging script), please give feedback
 - Tony: Need to fix this before uploading burn-in data to the database before building modules
 - Bruce: would it be sensible to upload it anyway?
 - Tony: can, but can’t be easily fixed afterwards. Right now every single part would be failed
 - Bruce: is it particularly NO or other tests as well?
 - Tony: also other test. Example: trim does not load (response curve fails)
