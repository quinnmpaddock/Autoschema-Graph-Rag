# 22/06/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1032185/ 
### Introduction
- The following steps are now ready for site qualification
 - 8.7 Hybrid Visual Inspection (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q0h-2y5_ygFjxDJdadmUOBPMrxGN9phIQMnX_nUDEA0/edit#gid=1389349516)
 - 6.3 Powerboard Visual Inspection (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q0h-2y5_ygFjxDJdadmUOBPMrxGN9phIQMnX_nUDEA0/edit#gid=2079540660)
 - 3.1 Sensor Reception Testing (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q0h-2y5_ygFjxDJdadmUOBPMrxGN9phIQMnX_nUDEA0/edit#gid=1915254925)
 - 8.3 Hybrid Assembly (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q0h-2y5_ygFjxDJdadmUOBPMrxGN9phIQMnX_nUDEA0/edit#gid=1389349516)
 - 13.3 Bond Pulling QC (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q0h-2y5_ygFjxDJdadmUOBPMrxGN9phIQMnX_nUDEA0/edit#gid=0)
- Issue with procuring RFID tags
 - For module test frames allow to use QR codes instead for now
 - Please use the DB generated QR code once you registered the tool
 - This is only a temporary mitigation to continue with frame prod where this part is currently unavailable, once part is back, we will stuff new frames with RFIDs again (will we “fix” older ones? -> assume sites can choose to keep QR sticker or move to RFID for the “mitigation frames”)
 - Hybrids will continue to use RFIDs (QR code is not a viable mitigation here)
### Powerboard site qualification
- Handovers from PB sites to industry and modules sites well understood?
 - Jacob doc is the “hybrid QC” equivalent, does not define the exact test but points to Timons QC doc
 - Also defines what is to be done at reception at module sites
- PB site QC needs to ensure docs are ready that have all the relevant “QC target parameters” included (you have to know what “good” means)
- Warpage? / metrology?
 - Currently in parts as comments in the QC doc, will be addressed
- Maybe add a visit as well, as we originally planned?
- Agreement on Timon’s proposal
 - Please finalise QC doc
 - Timon points out roll out of testing system + doc has to also be done asap
 - Then announce ready for review
- We have to then plan release of parts etc planning
 - Electrical PB reception testing begins to be requirement for module sites only from PPB (we do NOT require el tests of PBs at module sites for PPA)
 - However of course if you have test equipment DO test!
 - Timon would like to test testing equipment at sites, so please always leave at least one PB on the reception panel until able to test PBs
 - Yes, this is also a requirement
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R2 tool production
 - All parts machined
 - Significant fraction metrologised (hehe)
 - About to send out “fast track/trial order” to anodisation shop
 - This first set will go to Ca following metrology confirmation asap 
 - Once trial successful rest of parts will go for anodisation as well
 - Then final metrology
 - Then send out
 - Anodisation expected to take ~one to two weeks
- R5 tool production
 - most tools in hand at IFIC (registered in DQ and RFID tag attached)
 - found some combinations of tools that don't fit -> look into fixing it
 - other tools be produced in 3 batches
 - powerboard pick-up tool: company not able to assemble them, needs to be done at IFIC (need also check fitting with jigs)
 - Please provide up to date shipping info here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QdbWKPLVTP1uK6mV2fKNJh7lo0UFF-Fhqb8GB_p4pVY/edit#gid=0 
- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)
- Barrel hybrid tendering/order
 - Procurement should finally move more in next two weeks
 - Have about 170 thinflex hybrids
 - Will finish QC on them
 - Will attempt to use this set also to qualify material for production as a backup for DuPont
 - SMD scarcity - have sufficient for PPB, will keep a close eye on prod volumes
 - DuPond material for PPB is secured, however for prod we need to keep an eye
- Powerboard testing setup roll-out
 - Testing of boards that arrived progressing well
 - Will gather list of items required for sites
 - Should be able to have a good idea when it can be sent out in 2 weeks
- UK/China module thermal cycling setup
 - All UK ColdJigs delivered
 - Sheffield has already tested electronics
 - waiting to hear from other UK institutes
 - IHEP ColdJig
 - Received their chiller from RAL
 - Discovered it was faulty and was sent back for repairs last week
 - In the meantime have quote and delivery estimates for shipping crates
 - 3 crates for £350 and 3-5 days for delivery
 - once chiller returns (waiting for company to respond with return ETA), we will run end-to-end test before packing equipment for shipping (estimate 1 week)
 - S/W
 - V2 released
- Production of R0 and R1 test frames
 - Waiting for test with first R0/1 modules
 - These will be the ones in Ca
 - These are for production, so have a bit of lee room
- Production of R2 test frames
 - See above
- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames
 - See above
 - Purchase order for R3 and R5 is out, once design verified we give the go ahead
- Production of hybrid panel cover
- Production of stencils
### EDMS Status and PPA
- What is the next step on the way to make modules? Module loading sites are twitching
 - Modules currently cannot be built until all 26 steps are done
 - We might soon have to mitigate to release modules earlier
 - This would have to be somewhat aligned with the SQ process for module mounting
- Might make sense to send parts even before sites fully qualified (when they approach qualification) to mitigate shipping delay
### Wire-bond pull tests in database
- For numbering
 - ASIC backend, will program one ASIC and replicate, which makes wires start at 1 again
- Discussion about technical feasibility of implementation for numbering
 - Will have tool (mapping program) to help translate
- 
### [moved to next week] HV tabbing and SQ requirements
### [moved to next week] R5 tooling metrology
