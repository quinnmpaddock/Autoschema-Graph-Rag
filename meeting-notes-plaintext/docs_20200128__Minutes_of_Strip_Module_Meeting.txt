## Minutes
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- Comment to move weighing and bonding later in the ITk week session to allow maximal US attendance
 - Will be done
### Shipping box survey (Karola)
- Question on whether refers to all the shipping options
 - Answer, yes
### Prototype HV tab holder (Bart)
- Sven not sure length is well defined, Bart to discuss with Tony W
- However simple - something like this is useful to save time (Vitaliy)
### Test coupon measurements (Sven)
- ASIC lands on test coupons identical to hybrids?
 - Yes
- Metal trace variability should not affect shield layer functionality
- Via chain will remain?
 - Yes
- EC using same test coupon?
 - Kambiz copied the design as far as Sven knows
 - Dennis will make Kambiz aware of this change proposal
### Mechanical endcap hybrids (Sarah & Kunlin)
- Is 0.25mm core ok Dennis?
 - Should be ok
 - Wonâ€™t know 100% until tender process complete/more developed
- Prague would like to order more mechanical hybrids
 - Order is not yet closed, please fill in google sheet, Karo will add link to sheet to EC planning meeting agenda tomorrow
### UV and polaris epoxy temperature dependence (Jane)
- Temperature dependent calibration has been done (RAL) and worked reasonably for UV glue - not tried with Polaris
- Stencil might be more reliable, but one has to be somewhat crafty to be able to use it reliably
- How to check glue amounts?
 - Check by weight
- Tests for this talk were done for Polaris without hardener
### EC HV tab jig (Dennis & Marc)
- Should we move all EC Tabs to 5mm longer?
 - Better not to avoid knock on effects (e.g. in cold box design etc) and short tab will be produced anyway
### AoB
- Forest chimes in with an additional talk about wire bonding
 - Will be added to the agenda
