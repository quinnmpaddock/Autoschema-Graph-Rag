# 20/04/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1008271/ 
### Introduction
- SQ news: One can now do site qualification for the ASIC handling step
- Next week is AUW
 - Will contact dedicated speakers soon
- Introduction of new procedure document task force to push finalization of documents
 - Task force meet once a week (Wednesday) 
 - Go through up to 5 documents per week and discuss issues in meeting
 - Make decisions on open points, then tidy up documents
 - EDMS review of documents
 - 48h if document had already be reviewed several times
 - 1 week if document was not reviewed
 - Will inform authors if their document is under review from the task force
- Database dummy program will start as soon as issue with Executive user privileges in database are solved
 - Andy discussed ant already with Marek and they are going to work on it
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- Production of R2 toolset Urgent
 - more progress in local workshop, expect to have all parts machined within ~2 weeks
 - ramping up metrology (roping in help)
 - anodisation will follow metrology
 - will make sure anodisation shop is reminded to cover all round holes
- Production of R4 toolset Urgent
 - Have 5 sets of tools, still doing measurements (looking into issues with optical measurements)
 - Incontact with manufacturer with regards to vacuum pattern and unmasked holes during anodizing
- Production of R5 toolset Urgent
 - (task tracker updated)
 - Tools manufactured and anodized
 - Some tools rejected
 - Company will start mounting in 2-3 weeks
- Production of hybrid and module tools for the US Normal
 - Just received metrology on ASIC tray and pick-up tool Y after re-machining tools
 - Need some further look into metrology
 - Need to check that ASICS fit in chip tray
- Production of hybrid/module tools for UK/China Normal
 - All tools back from rework at Liverpool workshop
 - 7 Pick-up tools re-machined, but forgot HCC vacuum bit
 - Have enough pick-up tools for each group, so will ship them and ask workshop to have a look again at the wrong pick-up tools
- Order of hybrids for prototyping and PPA for the endcap Urgent
 - Prototype hybrids at Freiburg (out of tender)
- Tendering process for barrel hybrids Urgent
 - Everything frozen, probably able to release that after AUW
 - Gerbers need ASIC padrings to be frozen
 - SMD mounting of hybrid flexes should be relatively straight forward procurement process
- Tendering process for EC hybrids and powerboards Urgent
 - Good progress on technical specification and go though review
 - Delivery plan made based on schedule
 - Might be a bit too late for start of PPB
 - Prototype hybrids at Freiburg (out of tender)
 - Need to discuss about reordering parts
 - Could be a separate SMD part of tendering
 - Powerboard part of same tendering, but does not have to be same company as hybrids
- Design, finalisation and roll-out of powerboard testing setups Urgent
 - Layout comments on active board received, will be implemented and then start production of boards
- Design, finalisation and roll-out of module thermal cycling setup to UK/China Urgent
 - Waiting on control electronics to be assembled
 - Then test everything to confirm functionality
 - Star delivery with preliminary software version
- Design, finalisation and roll-out of module thermal cycling setup to US Urgent
 - - no report -
- Hybrid crate finalisation and roll-out Urgent
 - Have done tests at Zeuthen using dummy parts
 - Fan system is currently being integrated, software and gui progress well
 - Hardware might be ready by end of April
 - Start roll out by mid May
 - Software available by end of May
- Finalisation of panels for EC hybrid testing Urgent
 - TWiki page created with status of tested panels
- Production of LED bars for the EC Urgent
- order of powerboards for prototyping and PPA
 - Part of endcap hybrid order
### Glue Dispensing
- What is the room temperature variation?
 - Within +/-0.5 deg C
- Room temp is set the day before the measurement, so setup should be well adjusted by the time of the measurement
- Is 10% variation in volume too tight?
 - William: even within 15% coverage is good
 - Also inside of pick-and-place machine environment temperature is not monitored
- The critical temperature seems to be the dispenser tip temperature
 - Very expensive units have tip temperature control
- Situations where you might not be able to glue due to large temp fluc, how often expected?
 - Happens rarely, correlated e.g. with fires in the vicinity
 - Jane feels she cannot reliably predict the future :)
 - About 1% of the time is Vitaliy’s expectation for “rarely”
- How about cooling rather than heating?
 - Discussion, technically challenging, adds issues with mixing…
- Would be good to repeat this measurement with epoxy
### Reviewing site qualification steps (update)
- Two weeks, other two weeks if feedback, then maybe another iteration… this could take forever?
 - Two weeks are the max/deadline, usually we see that this is done more quickly
 - We however are worried about this too, we might have to tighten this and/or, in some special cases, deliver PPB parts when only a central core of SQ steps are finished at a given site
- This is going very slowly, can have financial impacts or add big delays on schedule
- In future might reduce the number of reviewers per step in order to speed up
 - Right now cycles are fast and 3 reviewers agree, likely as deliverables are well defined. We hope we can continue this, but yes, this could be a way to speed up
### EC tooling vacuum pattern
- Proposed simpler vacuum pattern looks like a good alternative for workshops that find it hard to to the original pattern
- TRIUMF will test proposed pattern on one example tool, will check for burrs and if sensor looks nice and flat when vacuumed down
 - If positive will use the simpler pattern
 - Difference: here anodised first, then grooved, for later jigs will be first groove, then anodise
- [... More discussion not captured ...]
### [will have to move to next module meet] Metrology Benchmarking Proposal
- moved...
### AOB
- None, out of time
