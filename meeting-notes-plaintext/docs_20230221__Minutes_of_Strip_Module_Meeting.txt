# 21/02/2023 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1253772/
### Introduction
- No more volunteers for ageing tests showed up
- Carles: False blue in DB?
- Luise: No
- C: what about the few modules for tests?
- L: Just reference in module information that it is false-blue but don’t need to track batches, so the glue won’t be in DB
### Institute Contributions: UBC
- Wiliam: 4 cycles with 4 chucks but 1 module. Didn’t stop at the end because it was not implemented by that time. 
 - Cole: entering a delay/sleep is very easy
 - William: using ethylene-glycol, were using manually set temperature, not 
 - Cole: you only went to -30C
 - W: yes
 - Cole: big difference. As many time to go to -30 as fro -30 to -35
- Carles: IFIC also looking into it and will help
 - Cole: Urmila already sent some results
- Cole: Prague is also looking into it
 - Pavol: looking into it as well, will contribute
- Cole: any other end-cap sites? Would be very much appreciated, even manually
- Tony: we should all be using the same constants, since we’re all using the same thermistors?
 - Cole: All using the same NTCs. Original calibration can’t be right. Only calibrated in a narrow range
 - Tony: should confirm if everyone is using the same parts and if everyone is, should all be using the same constants
 - Cole: recommend every site runs their own calibration. Dipping the NTC.
 - Tony: should confirm
- Tony: are you doing calibrations in the cycles you’re doing for the other temperatures?
 - Cole: Sometimes yes. Sometimes problems, buggy communication
 - Tony: don’t you have to do the calibration on each up and down cycle?
 - Cole: should be stored as long as ITSDAQ isn’t restarted?
 - Tony: do we need recalibration warm and cold?
 - Cole: question for ITSDAQ experts
- Cole: when running AMAC calibration, measured IV doesn’t make sense (either hundreds of nA pre-calibration, or tens of nA post-calibration)
 - Abe: shared current values that were measured at some point and seemed sensible, can check offline
- Abe to send the procedure for the calibration
- Luise: low current for the Peltiers seems to work better?
- Cole: yes. Currently experimenting with asymmetric currents for cooling / heating
Next meeting: LBNL & Adelaide
### Outcomes of debugging marathon
- Carles: how is the connection of the miniDP cables in the coldbox in EC? Done by the feed-through?
- Peter: yes
- Tony: what about barrel coldboxes? Plastic?
- Peter: yes (?)
- Luise: would like to know whether there’s any change
- Vitaliy: can use the end metal connector instead of peeling the plastic?
- Peter: if feed-through connector, OK but difficult if not
- Vitaliy: At testframe level?
- Peter: No, you will violate the shield
- For the testing with FMC-DP
- Craig: we don’t have a big amount of FMC-DP in hand, but expect 26 soon
- William: We were going to change these 3 delays. Hold on?
- Luise: still figuring out the correct way to do it.
- Tony: (confusion about a different 4th delay)
 - Paul: This is the “data delay”, the delay in the HCC on the Input Channel inputs, it is also affected by this and needs to be adjusted
- Initial values were old and arbitrary that worked sometime?
- Dennis: Craig found one point and I found the other point working the best 
- Phase space discussion:
- We need to cross check the means of the bits (as in the delay achieved to the bit setting for the 4 delay and the ABC input phase). 
 - Ash will probe and check what is needed to keep the relative phases the same.
- EC frames: collecting feedback on EDMS 
- William: PB testing: PB panels available? R0,1,2 now working and next could come in carrier cards.
- JJ: during debugging, used a crate. Did you find a problem of not being able to talk with AMAC?
- Luise: all panels just work. 
- Peter: we didn’t spend time calibrating, so maybe didn’t catch this.
- Dennis: can write but not read?
- JJ: only calibration failed. And seems that the calibration changes over time and needs recalibration
- Ash: version of AMAC?
- JJ: V2
- Peter: Steffania reported something similar for the barrel
- Paul: two issues: 1-loss of communication 2- change in calibration. For 2) how much is changing?
- JJ: well, the temperature it returns is very high value around 60ºC and if I recalibrate it comes back to normal.
- Nghia: can JJ send the error messages? 
- Dennis: You don’t have same version of AMAC (star and V2) [green vs purple boards?]
- Luise: please, report to the itdsaq expert list
- Luise: another burn-in debugging meeting next week or so?
- Peter: wed/thu next week will meet some experts in UK. We can set a meeting after that.
### Shunted tests in cold cycling
- Craig/Ash: leave AMAC on when cooling down and then turn on the DCDC.
- Ingo: we put on extreme mechanical stress and simulations showed that they can actually break
- Paul: better control delta T by changing the turn-on
- Craig: adjust turn-on procedure to avoid big temp gradient. 3 low-power modes released sequentially
- Paul: we can always use the shunts to ramp up perhaps even more slowly
- Luise: new command for turning on?
- Craig: can convert the current command 
- Dennis: the biggest problem is that we need to configure HCC in between to give clock to the ABCs
- Peter: I need to think about that
- Peter: what if we emergency power off everything? Risk of breaking modules?
- Vitaliy: what is the procedure when turning it on regarding HV?
- Turning LV on, turn HV-switch on, then ramp up.
- Vitaly: Interlock on sensor current? Yes, ok, interlock fired when problems with the R1?
- Cole: not in place at the moment
- To implement in the coldjig software the turn-on sequence. To document in the cold cycling procedures the sequence. In the meantime, circulate which commands are needed to do the sequence manually
- Andy: discussion in the UK long ago, test first warm. Is it still valid? → Yes, part of the warm test
- Craig/Luise: We want to leave the AMAC on when cooling. The question is when ramp down the HV because we want the AMAC being turned off-on. We can ramp the sensor down before cooling or when reaching cold temp. 
- Tony: we’d like in every cycle. Shunted full test, turn shunt off and go to the full cycle. Give comparison of shunted/not shunted for every cycle. Would that be ok? Anything more extreme needed?
- Luise: if you want to take more data OK, but not standard procedure
- From chat (Craig):
 - slide 3 here shows a start-up sequence on a module and how that procedure steps in current draw https://indico.cern.ch/event/932643/contributions/3956337/attachments/2078631/3490995/200724_AMAConModules.pdf 
 - and slide 4 here shows that my memory is wrong and (at least uncooled on an Al block) the increase and decrease of hybrid NTCs has a similar time constant on the way up as down (at least on old ABC130 modules!) https://indico.cern.ch/event/668881/contributions/2753070/attachments/1542850/2420287/AMAC_PDR.pdf
- (discussion on how many full tests to run shunted)
- Luise: need to define a bare minimum. Proposal: at the end of 1st cycle and beginning of last cycle. Can be included in the default testing sequence (putting an option of doing each in easy cycle or minimum). 
- Bruce/Abe: we will need more flags but yes, should be possible.
