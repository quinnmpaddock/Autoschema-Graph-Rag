# 07/07/20 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/927509/
## Minutes
### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)
- US plan for playing with bushings has been uploaded for reference, expect more over the next few weeks
- Will talk about EC using bushings or not in next week’s meeting.
 - Craig and Ingo will contact people to prepare some input presentations
 - Pointed out that remachining to retrofit bushings should be possible (but obviously cost a bit)
 - Ideally would like to avoid remachining at a later stage since that might require collecting and re-distributing tools from various sites
### Bond pulling summary (Wire-bond QC group)
- Current table extremely barrel focussed 
 - Need to include endcap case!
- Can’t design any “array jig” for the endcap right now since we don’t know the final vendor and related to that don’t know the final array size 
- Only UK hybrid arrays are tested at Liverpool, US arrays have to be tested in US
- Seems right now we would be pull testing a lot, should maybe think about defining something in the order of “testing once per X” with X to be defined (per # of arrays, weeks, months etc)
- For assembly sites, 100 pulls per array is a final sanity check (substrate and machine tested separately already) so descoped to every few weeks
 - Based on time rather than number of arrays to take different production rates into account (currently once per month)
- No objections to power board plans (Forest to contact Timon to make sure there’s nothing that got overlooked)
- Sensors: was discussed a while back that we’ll have some kind of central receiving site where sensor lot gets tested
 - Problem for some endcap sensors: not all sensor QC sites have wirebonder/pull tester
 - Solution: use database to ensure sensors are tested but doesn’t have to happen at sensor QC site, can also be at module assembly site
- Same for ASIC wafers (pull test per dicing batch, tracking that this happens through database batch QA/QC function)
### Waffle tools (Scott)
- How many bonds were put per row to get results?
 - Round 4 bonds
 - Square 2 bonds
- Bart’s experience with standard wedge showed concerning results wrt to bond force needed (could potentially damage things)
- Bond force for waffle wedge higher, but larger area distributes that force
- Could be advantage of waffle wedge by distributing pressure over larger area
- Question: do we have access to deformation profile?
 - There is a distinct difference for each wedge, but no damage was seen for any of them
 - Had to keep overdriving it to get repeatable bond force
- Is overdrive = overtravel? 
 - once machine finds pad, machine drives it a bit further to ensure proper contact 
 - seems to be called overtravel on Hesse, overdrive on delvotec
- Reason for relatively big numbers: bonding done on back side of halfmoons which were sitting on cleanroom wipe which is rather spongy and gives quite a bit
### Split module and database things (Luise & Sven)
- When do half modules get serial numbers? What if it fails afterwards?
 - Hybrids from same panel should be kept together
 - Hybrids from one panel used to make one module
 - If half fails, use serial number of HCC carrying module
 - This would mean we might end up with a set of 2 hybrids that would not immediately get used for another module to avoid mixing sets
- Current plan is serial number counts up, so introducing specified numbers at start of 7 digit chain would complicate things
- Would serial number be set manually?
 - Depends on if we have a GUI for assembly or not
 - If yes → automatically
- Would this interfere with automatic assignment of serial numbers for barrel modules?
 - There is the option to override serial numbers, could for the endcap have script that overrides the standard one
 - Currently only institute authorities can change serial numbers, have to change/check this
- You always build pairs of modules, so you should only mix halves of non-working pairs and in other cases always try to make one module out of one tested hybrid panel
 - This means if one half fails, put working half aside until you have another case where one half fails 
- Make list of (optional) trackable items? (bonder used, tool used, etc)
 - No objection, so take this as a yes
- Have to agree on tooling numbering scheme: strict scheme or just assign institute identifier and keep rest free
 - Where are serial numbers assigned?
 - Production site or reception site?
 - Probably best after metrology is done on them
- Whole idea is to avoid that people can accidentally assemble modules with wrong tools (in the database, not reality)
- Can people with more rights toggle their access rights?
 - No
 - Could create two accounts in that case (one with one without super rights)
- Consensus: serial number not institute specific but producer specific (so ab would encode manufacturer)
- Adding local name as property to tools would be helpful for sites in order to identify their tools
- Drawing number and manufacturer are already properties of tools but this does not necessarily affect ITk serial number
- Tools have RFID tag, since people need to read out RFID of hybrids anyway, not much additional effort to read out tool tag as well
### EC transport box and frames (Dennis & Kambiz)
- Once hybrids are approved, what’s the next step?
 - In MS we ask for similar samples and not final design hybrids
 - There are not going to be any final design hybrids at this stage
- Are there any orders outside of MS?
 - Kambiz preferred option would be to order small amount (20-40 hybrids) of each vendor
 - Would also allow for quicker check of vendor’s quality
- This would only be for pre-prod A!
- For pre-production B only final designs from winner of MS
- Need to have schedule and numbers for production meeting for pre-production A
- Need to make sure people fill out table with numbers needed and give us schedule of order times
 - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vKhicJ7CacqfUdRG9leoHsMcm_T7qT8jOGw2VEgfYeU/edit#gid=464877338
- Pre-prod A has rather small numbers, numbers ordered might be more than we need
- Also need hybrids for prototyping, but since we don’t have real sensors for prototyping, these would have to be build with mechanical sensors
- Hope review done by end of July so we submit final design of all flavours for production
- People to look at slides about transport frames so we can discuss on Thursday who will produce what
