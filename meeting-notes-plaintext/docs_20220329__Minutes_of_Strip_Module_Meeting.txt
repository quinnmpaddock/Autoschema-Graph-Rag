# 22/03/2022 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1109674/
### Introduction
- Release end-cap sensors to sites, free to use one prototyping module per type, remember to use PPA sensors only when qualified
- Ino: what does that mean?
- Luise: reception test only when qualified, same for IV, HV tabbing, gluing, etc
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- 29/03/2022: EC tasks
- 05/04/2022: Barrel tasks
- 12/04/2022: EC tasks
Production of end-cap R0 tools
Production done, to be shipped out soon, new issue discovered recently
Production of R2 toolset 
Almost done, distribution next
Production of R4 toolset
Done, tools being distributed
Design, finalisation and roll-out of powerboard testing setups
Most of modifications to support all ec types done. 
First PPA powerboards being sent out on panels
Electronics for powerboard testing in hand and should be sent out
Software and firmware in progress
Dennis to send out instructions on differences compared to barrel
Ingo: should we wait for instructions?
Dennis: You can start playing and tell me what you are doing
Boards for Prague and IFIC sent out
Design, finalisation and roll-out of EC module thermal cycling setup
Limiting factor the shiping back of the crates. Trying to make more crates.
Finalisation of panels for EC hybrid testing
R5 frames being reproduced and are expected to be distributed in time for PPB
Production of test frames
Have 20 of each test frame unpopulated being populated, minor change compared to previous version: changed HV filter, moved LED positions, no routing changes, only population changes
Can only be distinguished by looking at resistor
Production of stencils for the EC 
New frames made and sent to Freiburg, waiting for feedback
Craig: PB/hyb availability 
Uli: speed up can't comment but going faster than predicted
Powerboards: issue are missing shieldboxes, fast tracking an order of shield boxes, consider making shield boxes in house to speed things up
Craig: estimate for when powerboards can be sent out?
Dennis: first ones expected back in roughly eight weeks (end of May), difficult to estimate in-house powerboard QC
Craig: can this be sped up?
Dennis: can’t say before first batch has come back
Carles: first batch will only cover PPB1 ?
Dennis: should cover most of PPB (QC on the received PB can be first made only for PPB1 PBs)
### Institute Contributions
DESY-Z/HU
- William: do you have the pi from Lund?
 - Ingo: they don’t send the pi, they send the board, so go ahead and order a pi already
- Carles: what are you planning to do about the problem with the pickup tool?
 - Ingo: chiseled away the pin
 - Recommendation from Freiburg: file off/remove/cut off the pin
 - Carles: also observed on R0 prototype hybrids from Toronto
Birmingham
- Luise: could you maybe test at different low bias voltages to distinguish between bonded and unbonded channels
 - Laura and Phil: at which voltages?
 - Luise: 5, 10, 15 and 20 V
- Ingo: didn’t we also want to look into the burst scan?
 - Luise: yes, can be done with the root files, so please ensure to provide the root files as well as the result files
- Vitaliy: don’t understand the plot - what is shown there?
 - Phil: yes, here we’re testing whether the recorded bad/unconnected wire connections are correct and match the tested dead channels
 - Vitaliy: blue curve is not test data?
 - Phil and Laura: blue curve is known bad channels from wire bonding records showing bonds known to have failed
Montreal
- Carles: for the end-of user statement from Melbourne: are you in touch with them, do you need help from production management?
 - JF, yes, in touch with them
Next week: IHEP, Dortmund, IFIC
### GUI for hybrid tests
- William: looks great! Question 1: we always do an output delay scan before running tests, you don’t seem to do that
 - Christian: not enough of an expert
 - Dennis: not sure
 - Christian: send me an e-mail and we’ll see if it can easily be implemented
- William: does this use “full test” or individual tests?
 - Christian: creates C++ macros, try to use the same ones as in pull-down menus
 - Craig: is there a full test option?
 - Christian: yes, can just run full test
- Bruce: in general, most of these things should be embedded in ITSDAQ where possible, having a front-end is useful, but it shouldn’t do anything with individual tests - people should always only run the full test in ITSDAQ
 - Christian: it is running the test in ITSDAQ
 - Bruce: production procedure is to just run the full test, shouldn’t modify what the full test list should be in another GUI
 - Christian: when running the full test, GUI just calls FullTest in ITSDAQ
 - Dennis: very useful in the end-cap case, where different module types are in different places
 - Bruce: this could be looked up from the database: check fuse IDs, check hybrid/module types and then download config files
 - Dennis: difficult, because burn-in is the first GUI where hybrids can be mapped to hybrid types
 - Bruce: question for how ABCs are mapped to hybrids, which then becomes a more involved GUI
 - William: very useful for what Toronto needs to do (random combinations of hybrid tests)
- Christian: very happy for input!
- Luise: would be good to integrate two things in the configuration files
 - ABC probing results (from the database)
-> requires DB interaction
 - Phase space parameters from ITSDAQ scans to determine right config parameters
-> does not require DB interaction, local ITSDAQ interaction only
- Luise: result analysis - would this be a summary of all results?
 - Christian: yes, need info on how to analyse these
#### AOB
- Any volunteers for magnetic field tests?
