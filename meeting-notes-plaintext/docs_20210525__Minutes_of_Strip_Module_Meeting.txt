- Hybrid and PB VI and Hybrid assembly will follow the wek after
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R2 tool production
 - Only two more items left to be CNCed
 - Reference plane was used wrongly in workshop, which complicates metrology, iterations with workshop, might be there are some out of reference plane
 - Not anodised yet
- R4 tool production
 - First re-worked items to arrive these days
 - Will test with mechanical parts
 - Will send out a sub-set of all tools to all sites
 - Metrology setup is currently broken, waiting for spare part
- R5 tool production
 - All rejected tools re-received, two had to be re-re-jected
 - RFID tags are being changed to new ones, much better readable
 - Building first dummy modules
 - Spacers missing for PB pickup tools found in Zeuthen and sent to us
- US module thermal cycling setup
 - SW status - provisional PI image was exchanged
 - BNL box can cycle
- Production of R0 and R1 test frames
 - Australia waiting for go-ahead from Dennis
 - Data works, but waiting for first module
 - Try to have all these tasks reported in 4 weeks
- Production of LED bars for the EC
 - Bo progress for bars
 - Pbus PCB that goes into tools has been sent, Sweden and Zeuthen have not received parts and are next
All sites please purchase all the required Nexys and Genesys G2 boards NOW! (global shortage of Si parts makes unavailability, in the near future, likely - see e.g. the MicroZed board (current delivery time: 52 weeks))
### ABCStarv1 Classification
- Noone present, maybe did not realise talk was moved to today from last week?
### Powerboard test setup MicroZed shortage and HV discussion
- Support proposed update No 1: all powerboard reception sites need a power supply capable of 550V
- Can groups have a PC with Centos7 as a backup?
 - Not clear
- Craig: Also need to look for other DAQ on how to proceed with Centos 7, which will stop support during production
- Gerrit: why not use raspberry pi?
 - Karol: have looked at it
 - Gerrit: speed might be an issue
 - Dennis: USB behaviour is relatively bad, would not use for burn-in
### Image metrology
- Forest: using wire-bonder for z measurement, could damage wires
 - Richard: our wire-bonder uses optical measurement, not touch
- Ingo: lens corrections might become important when using this
 - Richard: can be covered and calibrated using a smartscope measurement
- Richard: use this method as fast feedback for industrial production at Canada or Upsala
 - Canada: will use standard metrology since it is fast enough
### AOB
- none
