- Finalisation of panels for EC hybrid testing
- Production of R0 and R1 test frames for the EC
- Production of R2 test frames for the EC
- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames
- Production of stencils for the EC
 - No news, waiting for tests in Freiburg
- PPB Module (ABCStarV1, HCCStarV1, AMACStar) with bPolV6 for irradiation in April
 - Hybrids are tested and work
 - Hybs and PB are glued to sensor with minor metrology excursions
 - Module bonding was finished today
 - Major issue - we found a bug in the G5 programming and saw the effect too late - for all R0H1 and one ASIC on R0H0 the upper 2 FE bond rows are set in height like the first, so they collide with the lower rows :(((
 - We wanted to test the module before the meeting but did not yet manage to wake it up (likely due to differences in V0 vs V1 chipsets?)
 - Made an appointment with Dennis tonight or tomorrow morning depending on timing of the module meeting
 - If we see shorts in the FE rows (likely) will remove upper 2 rows and attempt to re-bond with correct loops
### Institute Contributions
Cambridge
- Tony: How many bad channels were found with this test? 
 - Bart: Not so many as we have good yield so far, found correlated failures and think this was contamination on ASIC, could see a row of 9 that looked different than others
 - Only seen on RowTest, not on bonder feedback?
 - Yes, but we do not have the PIQC option and have rather loosely set bond criteria
- Tony: could you provide feedback to me wrt to this topic to decide if we need to keep the FE row visual inspection
 - Bart: will do, also we found a case where a wire got dragged along and shorted 5-8 bonds, will try to find picture
- Gerrit: glue mixer saves a lot of time and is well worth the high price
 - Bart: yes, but our budget cannot support this for all sites
U of T
- Urmila: slides 6 is what you uploaded to the DB?
 - Laurelle: explains the numbers, this is wrt your email? Yes, will contact later
 - Ingo: cold box: you don’t use isolation pad? Laurelle: just a quick test and with back plexiglass cover on.
 - Gerrit: slide 5. Tools starting to tilt: we suspend vacuum lines from the top. Also seen in US that it’s no good to use coiled up lines for the pickup lines (use them only for table based tools)
 - Gerrit: about tools wiggling. Check if pins go deep enough into bushings.
Next meeting: ? 
### GUI to upload test data
- Kenneth asks about the GUI framework.
- Ingo: will this be merged with the web app? 
 - Kenneth: will start checking and thinking how to merge
- Ingo: all shown is for barrel modules. Do you know about anyone interested in covering EC? → No.
### EC HVTabs - needs and available stock, current status
- Please check your needs ASAP (or even faster :) ), and provide feedback to Carles 
### AOB
- TonyA: At upgrade week we want to talk about descoping options for QC tests. There is a spreadsheet. Please provide feedback if you were asked for some
