# 08/06/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1032183/ 
### Introduction
- SQ … am too slow
 - Next to release: Hybrid Visual Inspection, Powerboard Visual Inspection, Sensor Reception
 - Email will go out when the last remaining database interaction is implemented (probably tomorrow)
 - Next to be reviewed by task force: Hybrid assembly, Module reception, module assembly and bonding docs
- ASIC counting update
- Reminder: all sites to present shipping updates in Thursday’s production meeting
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R2 tool production
 - Tools done in workshop, so far all metrology passed
 - One backside was out of spec, can be sealed with additional sealant though
 - Issue: anodisation workshop didn’t respond to request, tried alternative one but they can’t hard annodise 
 - Might try different workshop in parallel, will contact Freiburg to investigate who they used
 - Dennis has already sent information to Martin
 - Working on rest of metrology, once that’s done continue with anodisation
 - Will fast track one set for Canada to allow start of prototyping
- R5 tool production
 - No major news, company will deliver missing parts soon
 - All hybrid panel jigs remade
 - Some module jigs are still being measured
- Hybrid/power board tendering EC
 - Finished, on Monday tendering documents uploaded to CERN site
 - Review has finished
 - CERN will have to check it before it gets send out
 - Replies should then come within ~a month
 - Question: the response that our QC is too strict, where did that come from? → CERN expert
 - Ash received same feedback for barrel hybrids
 - Concern that failing QC coupons doesn’t necessarily mean that hybrids are not fine
 - Ash modified coupons to ensure sufficient plating of vias
 - Update in a month
- Powerboard testing setup roll-out
 - New active boards are being shipped 
 - Need some time to check them
 - FPGAs have been ordered and arrived, sufficient stock for production
 - Karol is working on adapter board
 - How about EC? Dennis assumes delivery of active boards within a month
- UK/China module thermal cycling setup
 - UK cold boxes have been delivered to module testing sites
- US module thermal cycling setup
 - Have software for other institutes, are starting to test it
 - BNL has been doing thermal cycling since over a year, other two groups are starting now
 - In process of commissioning them now
 - Update in four weeks
- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation
 - Have to increase the hole size on the panels a bit so they don’t get stuck on the panel jigs
 - Could start EDMS review as soon as updated versions have been uploaded
 - This only concerns production panel, so should not start EDMS review before all changes have been implemented
 - Update in 3 weeks
- Production of hybrid panel cover
 - Received shipment with missing parts
 - Cutting is going on, about 40% done
 - Can pick up partial orders to send out covers needed on shorter time scale
 - Will start adding inserts now, deliver first covers to Toronto by end of next week
 - Update in two weeks
- Production of stencils
 - PB stencils got deleted and have now a separate entry
 - Craig kicked off review
 - Should finish soon
 - Hybrid stencils got approved on EDMS, production is ongoing
- Production of module frame cover
 - Received all frame covers
 - Karo is preparing list how many covers should go where
 - If anybody needs some urgently let Christian know
 - Update in two weeks
All sites please purchase all the required Nexys and Genesys G2 boards NOW! (global shortage of Si parts makes unavailability, in the near future, likely - see e.g. the MicroZed board (current delivery time: 52 weeks))
### AMAC current measurement & referencing caps
- From 1.8k start seeing ADC sampling noise (there is an issue in the slides)
- Standard deviation is consistent when taking corrections into account
- Peter doesn’t believe that C17 is between Opamp and ground
 - Peter has no objection to remove hybrid capacitors
 - But needs another capacitor between HV-ret and ground
- Karol: 2 capacitors on powerboard 
 - Removing C12 accidentally helped a bit
 - C17 to HV-ref (inputs of Opamp?????)
- Dave: main recommendation is to remove the hybrid caps
 - Peter: still 10 counts of noise
- For PPB barrel powerboard release need to wait for endcap powerboard results because of slightly different capacitor use
 - Peter: HV-ref and HV-ret should both be coupled to ground plane via a capacitor individually; this is implemented in endcap powerboard, but not barrel
- Need to know if hybrid BOM change is required
 - On what timeframe?
 - Removing the capacitors could potentially require a ECR
 - Ashley: also need to consider the 2 capacitors from the cold noise issue
- Change in EC hybrids would only delay shipment by a day or so
 - Fine to do for Prototyping and PPA parts
Decision: agreed that hybrid capacitors can be removed (keeping the pads) - ECR to be prepared, Dave to sketch first draft
Dave to follow up documentation on powerboard capacitors.
### ASIC counting update
- Craig: 268 HCC at RAL almost covers EC PPA as well
 - Count Craig did … missed due to bg noise
### R0 Metrology
- Try to do a test with dummy powerboards to see if powerboard tools work
- Ingo: Optically measuring holes is difficult and sometimes not reliable
 - Cross-reference with touch probe showed better results, but not feasible to do for all tools
- William: not doing pin distance measurement, but test all tools fit
### [move to next week] Hybrid Package Height

### AOB
- none
