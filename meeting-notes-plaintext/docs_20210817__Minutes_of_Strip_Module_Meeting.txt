# 17/08/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1054926/ 
### Introduction
- Site Qualification News
 - Module metrology step is out for review till Friday
 - This completes all docs except for electrical testing (and small group docs, aka hybrid flex, powerboard flex)
- Paul has an announcement
 - Got review board ok for ASICs, submission of chips to fab to happen at end of this week
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R1 tool production
 - Will come back for rework, sorting out
 - No meeting called by Richard yet
 - 2 sites got into contact with Richard directly
- R2 tool production
 - Fast Track Ca tools back from anodisation look good so far, bushings inserted today, adhesive curing
 - Had issues with height metrology, will need to rework some pickup tools before anodisation
 - Rest of tooling to go to anodisation as soon as Ca tools done
 - Then reworked pickups as well
- R3 tool production
 - Got LEDs for R3 tools, working
 - Difficulties obtaining working power supply
 - M3 screw holes have not been tabbed (?) so this needs to be done still
 - Hybrid panels, there are some vac leaks near hybrids. Installed rubber gaskets a la IFIC and will send design to other sites
 - In contact with machine workshop to build spares
 - Would be a good time also to do the HCC pocket size adjustment
- R5 tool production
 - All tools delivered and acknowledged. Close task?
 - Toronto measured and confirmed metrology within 3 microns
 - Will think about this task as “Feedback on R5 tool” from now
- Barrel hybrid tendering/order
 - Received final quotation for production and going through it now
 - Ash thinks he is approaching the end game
 - Material issue with DuPont remains but are ok for PP
 - Hybrids should be available once prod ASICs arrive
- Endcap module thermal cycling setup
 - Postponed to talk next week
- UK/China module thermal cycling setup
 - All UK cold boxes delivered
 - Small upgrades at site have been done
 - Some sites have not yet unboxed, most however have
 - IHEP one: difficulties obtaining crate for shipment, but all is ready to ship once shipment items have arrived
- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out
 - Received feedback from beta testers about mechanical optimisations
 - Plans for parts are now in workshop, will receive material end of Aug followed by production afterwards
- Production of hybrid panel cover
 - Aim to ship before end of Aug
- EC glass dummy sensors
 - R2 Dortmund order is processed by procurement office, waiting for approval (~a week due to holidays) and then order
 - After order expect few weeks before delivery plus shipment
 - R1, R3 from Upsala
 - Will follow up after meeting, company communication was very difficult and stalled several times
 - Company claims customs issues
 - Stuff was paid and company has not delivered for months
 - Richard will also attempt to provide some more pressure
 - Previous orders were provided
### Module PPA and hybrid electrical test
- REMINDER: RELEASE OF PPA HYBRID COMPONENTS DOES NOT MEAN THE NON-REQUIRED SQ STEPS CAN BE SKIPPED, METROLOGY, BONDING, ELECTRICAL TESTS STEPS MUST ALL STILL BE DONE!!!!
- Please use the “Full Test” routine from the ITSDAQ menu as the standard test suite to run on everything (update ITSDAQ if menu item is not available)
- “Full test” is no longer slow, so the previously faster “confirmation test” is now in the past :) 
### Barrel powerboards for hybrid panels
- Storage: keep them in the shipping container in dry storage
- When groups qualify for PPA parts, they should also request the powerboard carriers
### Module/Sensor handling recommendations
- Picking up sensors and modules needs to be done from a grounded surface (tools)
- Should use the ESD sheets from Hamamatsu to handle sensors as much as possible
 - Otherwise use ESD safe tools
- Keep a close eye on sensor handling steps, they are a risk to the sensors, so try to reduce after PP
- If (barrel) module handling tools need to be made from ESD plastik, needs further development
 - Can easily switch between ESD and non-ESD suction cups though
### AOB
- All minutes now visible at:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yvCa8qAFvchv2YjjTv6Z9OJ5AieusgtD?usp=sharing 
- Craig uploaded metrology json and had to fight changing single quotes to double quotes when using the prod DB upload scripts (double quotes worked)
 - Matthew: you can generate an example on the fly, I can send command. This should be the current and most recent (might be that the example in the document is slightly outdated)
 - We should fix the doc also
