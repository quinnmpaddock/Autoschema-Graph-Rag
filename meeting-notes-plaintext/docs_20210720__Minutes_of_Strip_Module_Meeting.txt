# 20/07/21 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1054922/
### Introduction
- For assembly SQ, people can use prototype tools if they can show the correct assembly procedure and that the assembled parts are within specification
### Task tracker items
Updates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda
And also task tracker for updates
- R2 tool production
- R4 tool production
- R5 tool production
- EC PPA/prototype hybrid order
- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)
- Barrel hybrid tendering/order
- EC hybrids/powerboard tendering
- US module thermal cycling setup
- Production of bonding and testing jigs
- Production of R0 and R1 test frames
- Production of R2 test frames
- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames
- Production of stencils
 - Will be shipped as soon as parts are ready
- Production of LED bars
- 
### Planning for first tool-built EC modules
- Would it be good to have a time ordered list and remind people 1 week in advance that items should arrive/be shipped?
 - Yes, will try to find an old spreadsheet and update it
- Some items are “lost” in shipping, especially if items are meant to arrive in time
 - Not sure how to solve this
 - Try to ship items as soon as they are available
- Do powerboards also need to be shipped via CERN?
 - Should be possible to ship them directly from Germany to Canada
### Automatic Module Glue Deposition
- Did you check flatness of plate for robot? Could cause uneven glue distribution?
 - Haven’t seen this.
 - More important that the jig is horizontal, since the module jig defines the flatness
 - RAL has almost identical system, have not seen any issues either
- Glue volume control not done mathematically, but by test?
 - Do pre-dispensing on glass; watch volume to drop an if it is within target, do glue dispensing
 - Look into how to improve this, especially because of changes in glue over time
 - Even with manual dispensing, don’t recall to have done it better than 10%
### AOB
- Luise: talked about what to order from Andover, have attached quote for the correct Polaris (including pre-heating)
