# 16/08/2022 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1191622/
### Introduction
- Ingo: might it be less intrusive if the database sends an email?
 - Luise: this would show up when you do something, but if you get an email that might be too late
 - Andy: database should not be set-up to do automated emails, that’s beyond the scope
- William: challenge at PPA/production time is that components fail some tests, need also check how they fail
 - Luise: we are also looking into this as part of the descoping

### Institute Contributions
- 
Next week: 
### End-cap glue stencil update
- William: looked at all four weights uploaded a couple of days ago, but will have to check
 - Peter: didn’t track which ones were would, will check
 - William: for R3 there is more uncertainty because of the low number of objects
 - Peter: trickier to evaluate those
- Uli: (slide 7) do we have experience with those tiny holes to get glue through?
 - Peter: yes, they work
 - Peter: we have build a module with holes of this size
- Luise: in past when asking people if they want different stencils, they didn’t encounter issues with their old stencils (e.g. for bonding). Do groups now want to try the new stencils?
 - Luise: R5 already a request
 - Ingo: will try to mimic pattern with dispenser
 - Uli: would be interested if there are plenty stencils available
 - Luise: they haven’t been made so far, but if there is interest we can talk about producing them
 - Luise: have made R5 and R4
 - Peter: didn’t make R3, but can talk about this (and R1)
 - Luise: will send an email to ask for stencil wishes
- Sven: what is the thickness of the stencils?
 - Peter: 250um
- Luise: request: if you find missing/corrupted data in the database, please let us or the respective site know so this can be looked at.
### Slow control tests for hybrids
- HCC & ABCstar LDO enables
- release of HCC reset
- Hybrid NTC read-back
- ABCStar Shunt Control
- Calibrate input
- SSSH to AMAC
- Add: check ABC reset
- Ashley: just came up with a slow control test list, some things we are not doing right nowOnly if those test pass a full test should be doneIf they fail, should fail a hybrid
- Vitaliy: are all these signals available on hybrid panel?
 - Ashley: one of the reasons of using the powerboard is that all these signals are available and routed to the hybrid
 - Vitaliy: then implementation is just software?
 - Ashley: yes
 - Luise: all functions are already there, just need to come to a conclusion on what we want and then it can be implemented as a nice ITSDAQ macro
- Ingo: where did you foresee to run this? At the burn-in crate?
 - Ashley: could be a test that is done prior to loading the panel into the crate
 - Ingo: not sure if we decided that single hybrid panel test is mandatory
 - Ashley: is not mandatory, but can done in the hybrid crate as well
 - Ingo: it wouldn’t take long?
 - Ashley: no, is should not
 - Dennis: should also run on a module test to check wire-bonds
 - Ashley: should be done
 - Luise: run this test first before ramping HV?
 - Dennis: can do this test at HV
 - Ashley: SSSH might cause an issue with HV?
 - Dennis: it only resets the state machine 
 - Dennis: the only command resetting the AMAC is OF
 - Paul: that is what the design is
- Tony: if we do this without calibrated AMAC, will the results be reasonable?
 - Dennis: currently don’t have calibrated AMACs, hopefully later, currently only testing that communication works
 - Tony: any test on AMAC is useful (even uncalibrated) and then do calibrated test on a moduleNeed two different tests with slightly different requirements
 - Ingo: would you try to read HV or would you just try to read HV
 - Tony: would read 0
 - Ingo: if you read 0, that would be OK. Only an issue if you read something else
 - Tony: doing this test earlier could feed into the json files later
 - Dennis: for e.g. cold box tests, could use FMC-DP
- Luise: Is there anything that needs to be tested for EC?
 - Dennis: for design validation need to make sure that the LDO enable ends up at the correct place (only once for design validation)
 - Tony: are there repeater functions to be checked?
 - Dennis: yes, that is checked
- Luise: who has to write the software?
 - Dennis: I guess Bruce
 - Luise: so we need a list of test and then get the tests setup
 - Dennis: defining the results can be a bit tricky (LDO enable check which ASICs are enabled)
 - Tony: do you want to check the bPol output? And low power mode?
 - Dennis: already part of powerboard testing and checked there
 - Ashley: if you know the hybrid flavour you should be able to get an estimate for the current draw
 - Dennis: yes, for the hybrid test that would be true.
 - Dennis: ABC reset is missing
 - Ashley: was deliberately left since this is not from the powerboard
 - Added now to the list
 - Dennis: for design validation need some more expert look-up, but only once
- Luise: all hybrid types have been built now, so could organize to ship one hybrid panel of each type to Freiburg for Dennis to do the design validation
- Sven: should have this in the database as well
 - Dennis: ideally just have a binary list of tests that were passed
 - Sven: probably up to Bruce
 - Dennis: e.g. a boolean for each of these
