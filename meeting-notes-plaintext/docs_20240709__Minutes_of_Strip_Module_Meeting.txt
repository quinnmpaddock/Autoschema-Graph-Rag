# 2024-07-09 - Minutes of Strip Module Meeting
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1431649/
### Introduction
Presenter: Cole Helling
- Tony (Slide 4): How often do the orders go out?
 - Cole: Don’t know
 - Carles: It was every quarter for the loading sites
 - Tony: we are not going to use as much glue but we need to know how often its ordered
 - Asked Luise Offline, orders occur every few months.
Slide 6
- Tony: They(loading sites) move things onto on- core, we don’t need to do anything(module sites)?
 - Cole: module sites that don’t load don’t move them to On Core
No objection to this proposal
Slide 7
- Tony: Could Dennis or anyone at Freiburg let us know when they will ship things for peel tests?
 - Roland will let Tony know
### L4 Updates
No presentations, but there are minutes from Publications
### Group Updates: Birmingham/Glasgow
Presenter: Katie Walkingshaw Pass for Glasgow
- Gerrit: One thing that stuck out to me was slide 3; you said you had difficulty with alignment. In the US we don’t have this problem anymore because we have a redesigned plate with extra pins so you don’t need the tabs. The tabs have a few issues, such as cutting while on the plate. Also, while cutting them, they tend to slide. The alignment is better with these pins than the ones for the tabs, so it might be worth it to talk to Tom Johnson at LBNL.
 - Sven: the jigs that Glasgow have already have this feature. This is also part of the EDMS design. There will be dedicated tab cutting tools in the production tooling. When I shipped the tooling to Glasgow I'm pretty sure I shipped the pins needed for the alignment. 
 - Gerrit: Okay, wonderful
- Bart: Sven, do we not want to get rid of these pins if they are worse for alignment?
 - Sven: they are not better for alignment, the newer jigs have removable pins for the hybrid tab holes. You put the hybrid on, put vacuum on and remove the pins, you can use the other dowels if you want. 
Presenter: Juergen Thomas for Birmingham
- Cole: the most interesting thing on that module was the low current with the silvery paint stuff
- Tony: A few comments. If you go to the interposing work, we do our interposing on the hybrid assembly jigs, which means we keep the tabs. If you want to know that technique, reach out to Kirsten. For setting the tools, you have to invert the tool and measure it to see how it’s shaped and adjust the settings.
 - Juergen: Is there documentation on that? 
 - Tony: Tom set the method, I can look for documentation. Typically you set it up with a blank part and you pull the vacuum on the PB tool and adjust the pins to it.
 - Juergen: We should get in touch then, thank you.
- Vitaliy: A comment on the dispenser, I think we are using a different model but similar the interface is very nice, if you have any questions we can help
 - Juergen: Alright, thank you.
- Cole: I am interested in seeing the upgrade for the raspberryPi from Buster to Bullseye.
 - Juergen: Yes, the concern is the TC08 (Picotech) driver, which may not work, but we’ll let you know.
#### BNL Looking into IV Shapes – You Won’t Believe What Happened Next!
Presenter: Shubham Gupta
- Xavi: Thank you, slide 2: you mentioned that the fail happens when a test remains in the status where nobody accepts the deletion
 - Shubham: Yeah, I think that is the reason. We checked the serials and the DB passed them, but there were a few with deletion requests, and that may have been registered as valid tests causing the confusion.
 - Xavi: It's similar to when someone doesn't accept the shipment it doesn't end up at the site. The recommendation is to approve the delete requests as soon as possible.
- Xavi: It's important to mention we can't decide if a sensor passes or fails ourselves
 - Shubham: We cannot change it, but the analysis we do can decide. It might be that there was an issue or a mismeasurement and the IV analysis marked it as failed even though this wasn’t a true failure.
 - Xavi: Did you get the pass/fail [? missed a word or two]
 - Shubham: I think the IV analysis should be the same as everyone as the pass fail criteria is from Kenny’s web app. It looks at all the values and then decides whether it passes or fails. 
### AOB
- Sven: Do you want to have the barrel tool update now?
 - Cole: Good time to talk about that
- Sven presents slides
- Bart: Thanks for preparing. One complication to the suction cup thing 
- Bart now sharing screen 
 - Sven: You might not have noted it but I have plugged those vacuum holes in the design 
 - Bart: Very good, that I didn’t spot.
- Bart: This has to be rushed through now because the workshop that won the tender is just milling the PB pick up tooling now. So if we want to change this we need to make the decision before next week.
 - Cole: Do you want a decision now, or people to go home and think about it?
 - Bart: If we do it the official way now it will be too late, we have to do it unofficially if we want to make this change now, can we agree now?
- Vitaly: I didn't understand Svens comment about the vacuum holes being blocked
 - Sven: Different holes. [points at slides]
 - Sandra: Tom used silicone to plug the holes
 - Bart: That’s what I tried to highlight in these slides.
- Gerrit: We had terrible difficulties trying to find a replacement for the suction cups for the PB tool. The difficulty was getting suction cups with the necessary stiffness.
 - Bart: Quite sure. They are actually a bit less compliant than McMaster Carr ones because you have to set them at just the right height.
 - Gerrit: Collapsing is not the problem of compliance with the shaft itself. The suction cups are meant to be put on pedestals not in holes. 
 - Bart: They are a bit stiffer. I think Tony Affolder knows.
 - Tony: Those needed to be trimmed and it was really tedious. Are they the same?
 - Bart: Oh, yes. It’s a pain, but it’s more or less a one-time thing.
 - Gerrit: the final ones are really horrible
 - Bart: the injection mold has been done, 
 - Gerrit: Tony, do we want to follow up with Tom Johnson
 - Tony: The way we were told to use them was to trim and add to them. We kept having it poke things. We couldn’t get it to work.
 - Bart: maybe we should continue this offline then
- Bart: At some point we will have to order the injection molded parts but we will continue offline. With the US it's a bit of a mute point as they already have the tools.
