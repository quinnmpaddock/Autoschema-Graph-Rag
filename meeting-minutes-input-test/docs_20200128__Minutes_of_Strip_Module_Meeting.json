Write QC document for coils (Timon/Carl/Satish)\n## Watching brief\nItem | Responsible | Next update expected\nHV tab bonding | Jens | 03/02/2020\nHybrid crate roll-out | Ash | 03/02/2020\nModule thermal cycling roll-out | Dave/Ankush/Sergio | 03/02/2020\nPowerboard mass tester roll-out | Timon/Karol | 03/02/2020\nBarrel hybrid tendering | Bart/Ash | 03/02/2020\nBarrel powerboard tendering | Carl/Timon | 03/02/2020\nEC hybrid/powerboard tendering | Uli/Kambiz/Dennis | 03/02/2020\nEC tooling design/roll-out | Marc | 03/02/2020\nBarrel tooling design finalisation/roll-out | Sven | 03/02/2020\n- People listed as responsible will be contacted periodically by Craig & Ingo for updates (certainly on the date listed, if not before!)\n- Updates could be verbal, email or slides in a meeting\n## Minutes\n### Introduction (Craig & Ingo)\n- Comment to move weighing and bonding later in the ITk week session to allow maximal US attendance\n - Will be done\n### Shipping box survey (Karola)\n- Question on whether refers to all the shipping options\n - Answer, yes\n### Prototype HV tab holder (Bart)\n- Sven not sure length is well defined, Bart to discuss with Tony W\n- However simple - something like this is useful to save time (Vitaliy)\n### Test coupon measurements (Sven)\n- ASIC lands on test coupons identical to hybrids?\n - Yes\n- Metal trace variability should not affect shield layer functionality\n- Via chain will remain?\n - Yes\n- EC using same test coupon?\n - Kambiz copied the design as far as Sven knows\n - Dennis will make Kambiz aware of this change proposal\n### Mechanical endcap hybrids (Sarah & Kunlin)\n- Is 0.25mm core ok Dennis?\n - Should be ok\n - Won\u2019t know 100% until tender process complete/more developed\n- Prague would like to order more mechanical hybrids\n - Order is not yet closed, please fill in google sheet, Karo will add link to sheet to EC planning meeting agenda tomorrow\n### UV and polaris epoxy temperature dependence (Jane)\n- Temperature dependent calibration has been done (RAL) and worked reasonably for UV glue - not tried with Polaris\n- Stencil might be more reliable, but one has to be somewhat crafty to be able to use it reliably\n- How to check glue amounts?\n - Check by weight\n- Tests for this talk were done for Polaris without hardener\n### EC HV tab jig (Dennis & Marc)\n- Should we move all EC Tabs to 5mm longer?\n - Better not to avoid knock on effects (e.g. in cold box design etc) and short tab will be produced anyway\n### AoB\n- Forest chimes in with an additional talk about wire bonding\n - Will be added to the agenda\n## Actions\n1. Write QC document for coils (Timon/Carl/Satish)\n1. Email ITk week presenters and upload to indico (Craig/Ingo)",
