Could cause uneven glue distribution?\n - Haven\u2019t seen this.\n - More important that the jig is horizontal, since the module jig defines the flatness\n - RAL has almost identical system, have not seen any issues either\n- Glue volume control not done mathematically, but by test?\n - Do pre-dispensing on glass; watch volume to drop an if it is within target, do glue dispensing\n - Look into how to improve this, especially because of changes in glue over time\n - Even with manual dispensing, don\u2019t recall to have done it better than 10%\n### AOB\n- Luise: talked about what to order from Andover, have attached quote for the correct Polaris (including pre-heating)",
