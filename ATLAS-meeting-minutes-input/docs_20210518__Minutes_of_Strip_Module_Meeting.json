The process might be a bit susceptible to fraud (someone approving a review that wasn\u2019t approved by the reviewer\n- Jig cleaning and hybrid shipping now ready for site qualification\n### Task tracker items\nUpdates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda\nAnd also task tracker for updates\n- R0 tool production\n- R3 tool production\n- EC PPA/prototype hybrid order\n- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)\n- Barrel hybrid tendering/order\n- EC hybrids/powerboard tendering\n- Powerboard testing setup roll-out\n- UK/China module thermal cycling setup\n- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out\n- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation\n- Production of stencils for the EC\n- Production of module frame cover for EC\n- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order\nAll sites please purchase all the required Nexys and Genesys G2 boards NOW! (global shortage of Si parts makes unavailability, in the near future, likely - see e.g. the MicroZed board (current delivery time: 52 weeks))\n### Update polaris handling/storage\n- Would be good to store glue in dark container\n- Need to be cautious when storing glue cold, since this affects viscosity when mixing\n- No concerns about requested changes -> will be implemented, then site qualification can start\n### \n### ESD suction cups on modules\n- Gerrit: Only clear silicone cups don\u2019t leave remnants\n- Conclusion: don\u2019t use ESD suction cups.\n- Karola: would be good to send an email with the recommended suction cup type to group\n - Gerrit: highly recommends to use FIPA cups\n - https://www.fipa.com/us/sfu-a-o-6-mm-102-006-013/\n - Cup material: SI (Look for 102.006.013.2/17)\n### IV curve data format\n- Wafer number and sensor component number redundant, but use both to help with wrong user input\n- Use correct signs for voltage and current for raw data (as recorded by your measurement system), but plots should use \u201cpositive\u201d signs\n- \n### ABCStarV1 Classification (maybe next week)\n- \n- J\n### AOB\n- None",
