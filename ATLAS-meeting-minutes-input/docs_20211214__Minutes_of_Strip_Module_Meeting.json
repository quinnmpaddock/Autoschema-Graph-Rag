Additionally, if possible please cross-check the readout eFuseID with the expected, particularly for die positions 6 through 13.\u201d\n### Task tracker items\nUpdates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda\nAnd also task tracker for updates\n- 14/12/2021: Barrel tasks\n- 11/01/2021: EC tasks\n- 18/01/2021: Barrel tasks\n- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)\n - Is anyone able to send modules to CERN?\n - Craig: any specific case?\n - Luise: if it is necessary to ship parts through CERN, it would be good if this is possible\n- Irradiated R5 module for December 2021 Testbeam\n- Question from Sergio: noise results were extremely low, even without biasing, is that expected?\n - Dennis: saw a similar thing for R0module: noise for unbiased sensor went down after irradiation\n - Vitaliy: need to check the IVs again - they didn\u2019t make sensor before annealing\n### Controlled demolition: The tails from the Crypt [Silicon].\n- Does the width of scratch has an impact?\n - Andrew: there is a specification how many strips a scratch is allowed to affec\n - Andrew: width of scratch depends on force used to do it\n - Luise: would be interesting to measure the scratches and come up with a classification\n - Vitaliy: can try to measure it\n - Luise: look for better classifications of scratches, if they are an issue or not\n - Vitaliy: concern on big sensor is width and length (material can be dragged between strips)\n### Toronto Hybrid Feedback\nPanel foam attachment\n- William: would prefer inserts in panel as well, but don\u2019t think it works with the current panel layout\n - Dennis: panels are very dense in terms of usage and this is not easy to do\n - Luise: would it not be possible to just add SMD nuts to the screw holes that are already used for holding the foam in place?\n - Dennis: no, these holes are also used for other purposes.\t\n- L\n- Visual Inspection showed debris\n - William: probably from over-handling of panes for now, but not expected during production\u000bExtra steps could increase risk of damage\n - Luise: currently is required to do a picture of the full panel\n - William: is it more risky to take a picture of the panel without the foam, than doing it with foam but missing some bonds\nITSDAQ data upload\n- William: expected ITSDAQ to upload measurements automatically, but probably not happening soon; need to find a way to do this manually\n- Luise: better to just upload results to hybrids directly, not to the panel\n- Ashely: for EC don\u2019t make use of HCC ID?\n - Luise: we do, but currently HCCs are not in database\n - Luise: would be good to have some visual indicator which hybrid is where on the panel without electrical readout\n - Matthew G: currently tests don\u2019t exist in database, how uploaded?\n - William: added as comments to panel (pdf upload)\n- \n- Question: do we accept hybrids with known flaws, or do we only accept good parts?\n - William: there was one ASIC, but it didn\u2019t prevend us from doing the test\u000bHad no spare parts to replace the ASIC\n - William: still no replacement parts for PPA\u000bOnly saw 2 problems, maybe something changed during shipping\n - William: have only exactly the number of ASICs for PPA\n - Luise: would be possible to get category B ASICS\n - William: still there is no rework, would have to make a whole new hybrid\n - Andy: one failed ASIC preventing tests is worrying\n - Ashley: Did you check the chip?\n - William: yes, didn\u2019t see any issues\n- Ashley: intermittent issues are concerning (something working at one site and not at another)\n - Dennis: probably because we are running at a small phase space of settings\n - Ashley: Were all the passives assembled in Industry?\n - Dennis: yes\n - Ashley: might be something with the end termination????\n- \n### Metrology results and implications\n- Ash: underlying issue is being addressed: removing solder resist from cutting area to make cutting easier and mitigate issue\n- Ash: need to wait and see what happens with PPB hybrids\n- Andy: Were you able to wirebond all the hybrids okay or did any of the rotations cause any problems?\n - Vitaliy: yes, all were wirebondable\n - Kirsten: for the very rotated one: no problem finding them and bonding\n- Craig: Are our specs unnecessarily tight?\n - Sven: keep in mind the specs weren\u2019t made to ensure bondability, but to ensure small wire bonding angles\n- Craig: on stave side, have seen tape misplaced by millimetres and things are still bondable\n - Ash: keep in mind the density of wirebonds\n- Vitaliy: also if shift in X becomes large and glue is applied to back of hybrid, it could result in glue on the guard ring\n- Andy: worst case hybrid: was metrology needed to see this problem or could you see the problem by naked eye?\n - Forest: rotation was visible\n- Andy: Can we do it by eye instead of metrology?\n - Vitaly: can\u2019t see a 200um shift\n - Matthew: it\u2019s only a 10min program\n- Luise: is the solder resist also removed from the tabs for EC?\n - Dennis: not sure\n - Ashley: remembers in review that it was removed\n - Forest: even missing solder resist would push the hybrid onto the \n- Andy: Did you have a good vacuum connection on the panel jig?\n - Forest: no indication there wasn\u2019t\n- Sven: slide 3: powerboard placement seems very similar to the hybrid placement and they don\u2019t have tabs, so maybe it is not just the tab cutting?\n - Vitaly: part of worry was that there could be an issue with the hybrid jig\u000bBias was felt more than the allowed tolerance\n- Ashley: Does the bias change with the order in which the tabs are cut?\n - Forest: probably, but we have always cut the tabs in the same order\n - Ashley: maybe do the cutting diagonally since there are 4 tabs\n - Forest: do you mean the tabs on the array\n - Vitaly: there is a hole between the tabs\n - Ashley: might be interesting to look into cutting this diagonally\n - Craig: done tests at RAL a while a go and it\u2019s quite tricky; if cutting the tab with the hole first and then the tab with the slot works better than the other way around\n- William: this depends on the existence of the 5mm pins, don\u2019t have them in the end-cap\n - Vitaliy: how do you align them?\n - William: with three pins\n - William: why are there these 3 large pins?\n - Forest: use them since the default pins are a bit too tight to do it\n - Luise: can cut off the tabs for EC and re-align the hybrid afterwards\n- Any comments from the UK:\n - Glasgow received two panels of hybrids and they all worked\n - Seems to be the common experience in the UK\n - Dennis: running in small area of working phase space, probably a problem of running out of the phase space\n- Ash: were all the hybrid flexes populated in industry or by hand?\n - Dennis: in industry\n - Ash: would be interesting to look at termination and see if we are on edge somewhere\n### AOB\n-",
