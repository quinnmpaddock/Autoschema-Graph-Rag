Not sure\n - This is what destroyed the R4 tools, so need to plan it carefully\n - Will try to use precise CNC machine that built the tools\n - If we cannot will fall back to careful artisan work\n- R3 tool production\n - Some tools do not seal well, silicone from R5 is great, might go same route\n - Essentially done\n - Everything that was planned to send was sent\n- R5 tool production\n - Tools have arrived at sites\n - Very carefully packaged\n - Look very good\n - Initial tests from Toronto look great\n- Powerboard testing setup roll-out\n - EC ones submitted\n - EC also received the FPGA replacement boards\n - LBNL work ongoing with high prio\n- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out\n - Fans arrived yesterday\n - Carl Beichert awaiting feedback from beta sites before work is started for CNC-ing\n - Simple copy and paste instructions on how to bring up the setup would be great on the twiki\n - Ash will check and add info\n - https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/Atlas/HybridBurnInCrate \n- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order\n - completed\n- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)\n- Barrel hybrid tendering/order\n - received quotation for pre-production circuits at Liverpool\n - everything looks OK and material is available\n - production time <35days, need to sign off documents to start\n - bare circuits might be in hand in September, not sure about contract for SMD population\n- EC hybrids/powerboard tendering\n - In negotiations between companies and CERN\n - Companies asked questions, CERN is providing answers\n - Material availability is BIG unknown which will impact schedule / timeline\n- Endcap module thermal cycling setup\n - Sergio will give update in 2 weeks (just back from holidays)\n- UK/China module thermal cycling setup\n - Upgraded Birmingham ColdJig to be returned today.\n - In addition, Birmingham will be taking one of our spare chillers.\n - Order for IHEP shipping crate gone out.\n - When Craig Sawyer returns from leave, we will arrange the collection and shipping of the IHEP ColdJig\n- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation\n - waiting for first EC electrical modules and results from those tests\n- EC multiple module box transport box\n - Box loaded today with mechanical R2Star to be shipped to Valencia\n - Then back to Zeuthen\n - This is to be the final test before final sign off\n - Planned to finalised in 3 weeks (due to vacations)\n- Production of bonding and testing jigs\n - Ready to be shipped this Friday\n- Production of R0 and R1 test frames\n - waiting for first EC electrical modules and results from those tests\n - In parallel iterating with company for manufacturability \n- Production of R2 test frames\n - waiting for first EC electrical modules and results from those tests\n - Have to go through CERN tender so pre-order of SMD cannot be done\n- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames\n - waiting for first EC electrical modules and results from those tests\n - In parallel iterating with company for manufacturability \n - Also buying SMD parts already (due to long lead times)\n - Company is awaiting final go after first module tests\n- Production of stencils\n - Postpone to next week\n- Production of LED bars\n - First set sent to Ca\n - Remaining parts to be delivered after Dennis holiday\n - Week before ITk week\n- Production of module frame cover\n - \n### AOB\n- Polaris glue mixing ratio from company (100:15) is different than what we use (100:9)\n - Company confirms that it only affects pot life and cure time\n - Decision: stay with what we use\n -",
