They then will release the parts (PM team for the number of parts)\n - Bart: would thought this was more for the cluster manager to decide?\n - Luise: this is a lot easier for barrel than for EC\u000bIn barrel the cluster managers can/will organise part distribution within cluster\u000bThis does not work for EC, where parts are distributed across different clusters\n- Visual Inspection:\n - Vitaliy: might be good to re-take the IV, if it was done only once\n- EC modules:\n - Andy: did the previous \u201cFrankenstein\u201d modules had high noise?\n - Dennis: there were higher noise, but not as extreme as Luise. On the test frame the noise was higher than on the petal.\n- GS: what is the news for the availability of ABCStarV1 for PPB?\n - Craig: first batch of probed ASICs are on route to DA (diced)\u000bArrival from dicing vendor to DA is imminent.\u000bSecond batch of wafers is to be diced soon\n - GS: when should the first ASICs arrive at the sites?\n - Craig: once they arrive, shipping will happen as soon as possible.\n- Tony: review of burn in, does it include the database section as well?\n - Luise: yes\n- Tony: hybrid test is approved, will this be released soon?\n - Luise: later in meeting\n- William: is hybrid burn in deployed and available to be used?\n - Dennis: can confirm that all EC hybrid panels can be run in crate\n### Task tracker items\nUpdates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda\nAnd also task tracker for updates\n- 15/03/2022: EC tasks\n- 22/03/2022: Barrel tasks\n- 29/03/2022: EC tasks\n- R0 tool production\nNo news\n- R1 tool production\nNew tools made and produced, should have improved heights and better fit\n- R2 tool production\nRemaining tools sent out, waiting for sites to confirm they\u2019re happy\n- R4 tool production\nRemaining tools delivered, metrology done, to be sent out\n- Powerboard testing setup roll-out\nNo news\n- Endcap module thermal cycling setup\nBeing distributed\n- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation\nReview ongoing\n- Production of R0 and R1 test frames\n- Production of R2 test frames\n- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames\nReview ongoing\n- Production of stencils\nPrague looking into it\n- PPB Module for April Irradiation\nDedicated discussion at the end of meeting\n### Institute Contributions\nGlasgow\n- Timon: The failing test is a temperature measurement. There is a fix for some of the tight thresholds, especially the temperature measurement since this can depend on the environment temperature.\n- Vitaliy: outlet to spread the flow of dry air would be good\n- Luise: maybe share design of new module box on a Twiki page if other people want to copy?\nPrague\n- No questions\nAdelaide\n- Not sure if they need a microscope for visual inspection -> yes, need one\n- Luise: would also probably be possible to provide some parts to progress the site qualification\nNext week: BNL, UiO, DESY-Z\n### GUIs for metrology and wire bonding uploads\n- Theo: there is a program that does the analysis for barrel modules, so can be nice to combine the two\n- Kenneth: do you take the test schema from the database, or is it hard coded?\n - Graham: it is hard coded in the python\n- Luise: the goal is to have an interface that can upload the required raw data files to the database\n - Graham can help with that part, just send an email\n### Update: hybrid test result upload\n- Luise: beta-testing phase of the database upload for hybrid test into databas\u000bWould be nice if groups could try using them and give feedback to Bruce and Christian\n- Luise: when the instructions are ready, will release the step for site qualification\n### Testbeam module planning\n- Luise: need to build several modules for this\n - 2 modules for irradiation campaign at CERN in May\u000bSS module at Liverpool, R1 module at DESY\n - Is this doable at DESY-Z?\n - Carl: should be able to do this\n - ASICs from Prague, sensor should be in hand, powerboard from Freiburg\n - SS module at Liverpool\n - Powerboard from Timon\n- Luise: Also prepare an irradiated R0 module as backup in case the irradiation causes any issues\n - OK to not pre-irradiate the ASICs\n - Is there a way to get an irradiated R0 sensor?\n - Have to find someone to build the irradiated module (maybe Valencia?)\n#### AOB\n- No other business",
