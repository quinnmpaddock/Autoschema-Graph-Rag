Maybe have to investigate what the minimum is (also if tabs will have wiggles)\n - Forest: if these tabs is what we get, need to start looking into the wiggles\n - Bonds on half-moons need to be superior to cicorel card, so if bonds on real object fail it\u2019s on the stave not under the sensor\n- Tony W. is waiting for feedback before making new tabs; anyone who did tests should provide results to Tony W.\n - Would be good to gather the results and compile them before sending them to Tony W.\n- Richard: what is seen here is probably not a normal oxide layer but rather some form of contamination\n- Need a meeting to collect results\n - Also need something from EC, but needs more time\n - Can try to organize a meeting to give Tony some feedback so he can produce more tabs; maybe next week\n### Strip Module IV\n- When are merge requests to be processed?\n - Slow going: comparison gui is merged, others need more time (in contact with Bruce)\n- Are you planning to make a tutorial on how to use everything?\n - Jupyter notebook tutorial is part of merge request\n### EC Hybrid/Powerboard Procurement Status\n- William: are the hybrids they are handling from Wurth?\n - Uli: yes, the design is not final but some changes might not be as drastic as you wish for\n - William: Is there a possibility to have the hybrid removal more similar to barrel?\n - Dennis: it's a more high risk change, can talk with Wurth about it but will probably not change\n - William: struggling with current design and have to see\n - Uli: this technical change is risky and will probably not happen\n- Tony: What needs to be approved?\n - Uli: pads for HCC and decoupling capacitors\n- Tony: what is the plan if SMD tender is not ready when the hybrids arrive?\n - Would probably circumvent tender to get first parts populated\n - First 1-2 hybrids will be hand stuffed to build modules and test the design (also at 640MBit)\n- Luise: will there be crossed wirebonds around HCC?\n - Dennis: for ABCV0 there was a flip and there is a hook in the trace so that no crossing bonds are required\u000bThis hoock will be dropped for PPB and production with the new chip design\n### Discussion - Storing sensors for modules\n- Tony: big issue is sites that don\u2019t have probe stations\n- Luise: for option 2, how low would the percentage need to be to do this?\n - Bart: Hamamatsu warranty stretches for 10 months (?) so something could be done\u000bDon\u2019t see issue putting sensors back in envelope after test\n - Luise: mainly handling, and would need another IV if module is assembled >3months later\n - Bart: for UK use already custom carriers, so no additional handling, for sites with probe station is already a lot of handling\u000bWouldn\u2019t cut on number of tests\n - Jonas: disagrees since wire-bonding and removing is a delicate process and they don\u2019t have enough frames\u000bWould skip reception IV as long as there is a storage issue and only test when shipping\n - Gerrit: agrees with Jonas;\n - Tony: want to show that shipment causes damage through reception test (Luise agrees)\n - Luise/Tony: would probably still have to do visual inspection to make sure sensors are not physically damaged\n - Luise: IV would find humidity issues; maybe only do it when humidity logger is triggered\n - Tony: need to open up every envelope?\n - Bart: probably only if outer package is damaged\n - Gerrit: never seen sensor that is broken in shipment from HPK\n - Phil: only have seen debry in packaging from dicing, that could damage sensors\n - But would show up at sensor testing sites already\n- Tony: do we have to check at least the first shipment from a site to make sure everything is fine?\n - Gerrit: do it during pre-production\n - Tony: do full reception testing for PPA/PPB sensors\u000bThen from this experience can scale down on IV/Visual Inspection for production sensors\n - Luise: makes sense to collect data during pre-production and then look how much testing is required\u000bWould at least test 1 sensor per delivery\n- Plan: do all test for PPB; store everything in envelopes for storage planning\n- Gerrit: for pre-production will do testing on test frames, do we have to put them back in envelopes for pre-production?\n - Tony: keep them on frames; receive them as you would do for modules (reception test, tabbing, re-test)\n - Luise: up to sites! Comment above true for US, but people might prefer to store sensors in envelopes and of course they can\n### AOB\n-",
