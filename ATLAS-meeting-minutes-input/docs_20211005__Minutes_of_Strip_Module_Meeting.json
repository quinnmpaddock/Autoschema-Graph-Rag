Some parts were sent by Freiburg in replacement.\nFreiburg to compile a list of missing parts and then start making them in the machine shop\nToronto has not gotten around to sending their parts back, short on hybrid jigs and waiting to receive their spares\n- R2 tool production\nParts to be shipped back from anodisation, then do metrology, then distribute\n- R4 tool production\nFirst R4 tools have arrived and are being measured and tested, hopeful to start sending out tools soon\n- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)\n\tNo news\n- Powerboard testing setup roll-out\nDennis is waiting to be told where to send out the other powerboard reception test setups\n- UK/China module thermal cycling setup\nShipping crates arrived and waiting for shipping paperwork to be completed\n- Production of bonding and testing jigs\nAll shipped and distributed, also registered and shipped in the database, spares will be sent out later together with the foils\nExperience from Freiburg: bonding jigs aren\u2019t very flat, difficult to make air-tight, sites please check \nPlease ask Dennis for test frames so that the jigs can be tested\n- Production of hybrid panel cover\nBoxes shipped, currently on hold\n- Production of stencils\nStencils should be finished next week, should be sent out next week\nDoes this include the powerboard stencils? Prague not sure\n- Production of LED bars\nAll produced, just not sent out - most sites should have LED bars and will get the rest when they ask for other items\nToronto saw that an LED burned out -> not good, should last longer, need to keep an eye on early failure rate\nCan send out replacements if being asked\n- SMD tendering for EC pre-production/production hybrids\nNo news this week\n### Production Planning Meeting Summary\n- Sites should really qualify for sensor reception!\n- If sites are not qualified for sensor reception, they can\u2019t do it within the required 4 weeks\n### Thin flex qualification summary\n- Timon: how activated are these after proton irradiation? Sven: only minor (below threshold)\n - Task: follow up with Birmingham about the spectroscopy results\n### HV tab VI summary\n- Question: add reception criteria to HV tab document by authors?\n - Forest: agrees to do this\n- How is this done in production? Does every site have to do it?\n - Ideally all VI is done in Oxford, and sites would initially check for shipment damage.\n- Latest batch of HV-tabs have barcode. Would be good to add this to the HV-tab procedure document (serial numbering).\n - Forest agrees.\n- Was there a discussion about the weld strength? With latest batch it was hard to achieve the target\n - No\n - Waffle wedges have currently a long lead time (3 months)\n- With HV-tabs not at final product stage, is this still open for qualification?\n - If a group has enough tabs without damage they can use them for qualification.\n- There was even some concern about the tab welding criteria. There was an agreement to not change the targets at this point\n - Groups are encouraged to test using more than 4 welds per tab so see if this improved the pull strength\n - And maybe also the weld pattern\n- Forest: parameters/ criteria should only be changed after more groups have done full studies and present their results\n - Bart: no intention to scrap requirements, just also making the point that we need more data\n - Everyone agrees\n- Bart: are we going to organise another meeting to discuss results from all groups?\n - Not sure at this point if all endcap sites had enough time for tests.\u000bProposal to look at this again in ~2 months\n - If groups are short on waffle wedges, please inform your cluster clerk so that community can look into sharing parts\n### End-cap module planning\n- Sergio: it also makes sense to load the V0 (prototype) modules onto a petal, e.g. second side of electrical petal or wait for dummy petal with cooling loops (no electrical brakes)\n - Craig: second side of current electrical petal would be interesting to follow up (if we can get a slave EOS)\n - Dennis: slave EOS available, since it was planned to load the second side\n - Luise: was a plan to use the second side for loading qualification at Freiburg, so they might need another object to do this\n - Sergio: are going to order parts for one more additional petal core (available in ~6-8 weeks)\u000bCould actually load petal in Europe, not in Canada\n - Luise: agreement to make the prototype parts and to not mix V0 and V1 modules on a petal\n - Cold test is important with parts\n - Then can discuss where they go to\n### First results from ABCStarV1 hybrids and modules\n- Luise: hybrids are shown at stage \u201cASIC attachment\u201d, not \u201cwire bonded\u201d. Is there a reason for this?\n - Matthew: no. are currently working on implementing test upload for wire bonding test\u000bAlso: Auto stage transition is currently not done\n - Sven: automatic transition currently switched off\n### Testbeam results for Irradiated SS and R0 modules\n- Please send feedback to the testbeam ACs\n### HV tabbing results at QMUL\n- Forest: Great progress. SCIPP found bonding close to edge is a bit different (parameters tuned for centre of tab)\n- Forest: Number of welds can also depend on tool shape (SCIPP tool different than that at QMUL)\n- Forest: Using manual machine has its own risks in terms of setting parameters and potentially repeating them after they had been changed\n- Bart: Idea of nonlinear pattern motivated by failure mode of tab (when welds in line, tab rips apart along the welds)\n- sdsd\n### Screws for EC panels and test frames\n- Carles: If nobody disagrees, sites should buy screws for production parts themselves\n- Sergio: do test frames need screws and washers?\n - Dennis: no, just need screws\n - Sergio: need washer in certain position to keep cover in correct position?\n - Dennis: for cold box, remove top and back cover (foam stays in position), then put top cover back on in cold box\n- Sergio: are all screws metal?\n - Dennis: for shipping all are steel, for cold box those connecting to metal should be nylon\n- Karola: would be good to have some slides/pictures on how to assemble everything\n - Dennis agrees to make them\n- Sergio: it would be nice to have a way to remove the bottom cover without having to remove the top cover\n - Marc: but would have to remove the screws anyway to replace them with nylon\n### AOB\n- no",
