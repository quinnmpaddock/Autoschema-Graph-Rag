What if it fails afterwards?\n - Hybrids from same panel should be kept together\n - Hybrids from one panel used to make one module\n - If half fails, use serial number of HCC carrying module\n - This would mean we might end up with a set of 2 hybrids that would not immediately get used for another module to avoid mixing sets\n- Current plan is serial number counts up, so introducing specified numbers at start of 7 digit chain would complicate things\n- Would serial number be set manually?\n - Depends on if we have a GUI for assembly or not\n - If yes \u2192 automatically\n- Would this interfere with automatic assignment of serial numbers for barrel modules?\n - There is the option to override serial numbers, could for the endcap have script that overrides the standard one\n - Currently only institute authorities can change serial numbers, have to change/check this\n- You always build pairs of modules, so you should only mix halves of non-working pairs and in other cases always try to make one module out of one tested hybrid panel\n - This means if one half fails, put working half aside until you have another case where one half fails \n- Make list of (optional) trackable items? (bonder used, tool used, etc)\n - No objection, so take this as a yes\n- Have to agree on tooling numbering scheme: strict scheme or just assign institute identifier and keep rest free\n - Where are serial numbers assigned?\n - Production site or reception site?\n - Probably best after metrology is done on them\n- Whole idea is to avoid that people can accidentally assemble modules with wrong tools (in the database, not reality)\n- Can people with more rights toggle their access rights?\n - No\n - Could create two accounts in that case (one with one without super rights)\n- Consensus: serial number not institute specific but producer specific (so ab would encode manufacturer)\n- Adding local name as property to tools would be helpful for sites in order to identify their tools\n- Drawing number and manufacturer are already properties of tools but this does not necessarily affect ITk serial number\n- Tools have RFID tag, since people need to read out RFID of hybrids anyway, not much additional effort to read out tool tag as well\n### EC transport box and frames (Dennis & Kambiz)\n- Once hybrids are approved, what\u2019s the next step?\n - In MS we ask for similar samples and not final design hybrids\n - There are not going to be any final design hybrids at this stage\n- Are there any orders outside of MS?\n - Kambiz preferred option would be to order small amount (20-40 hybrids) of each vendor\n - Would also allow for quicker check of vendor\u2019s quality\n- This would only be for pre-prod A!\n- For pre-production B only final designs from winner of MS\n- Need to have schedule and numbers for production meeting for pre-production A\n- Need to make sure people fill out table with numbers needed and give us schedule of order times\n - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vKhicJ7CacqfUdRG9leoHsMcm_T7qT8jOGw2VEgfYeU/edit#gid=464877338\n- Pre-prod A has rather small numbers, numbers ordered might be more than we need\n- Also need hybrids for prototyping, but since we don\u2019t have real sensors for prototyping, these would have to be build with mechanical sensors\n- Hope review done by end of July so we submit final design of all flavours for production\n- People to look at slides about transport frames so we can discuss on Thursday who will produce what",
