Didn\u2019t stop at the end because it was not implemented by that time. \n - Cole: entering a delay/sleep is very easy\n - William: using ethylene-glycol, were using manually set temperature, not \n - Cole: you only went to -30C\n - W: yes\n - Cole: big difference. As many time to go to -30 as fro -30 to -35\n- Carles: IFIC also looking into it and will help\n - Cole: Urmila already sent some results\n- Cole: Prague is also looking into it\n - Pavol: looking into it as well, will contribute\n- Cole: any other end-cap sites? Would be very much appreciated, even manually\n- Tony: we should all be using the same constants, since we\u2019re all using the same thermistors?\n - Cole: All using the same NTCs. Original calibration can\u2019t be right. Only calibrated in a narrow range\n - Tony: should confirm if everyone is using the same parts and if everyone is, should all be using the same constants\n - Cole: recommend every site runs their own calibration. Dipping the NTC.\n - Tony: should confirm\n- Tony: are you doing calibrations in the cycles you\u2019re doing for the other temperatures?\n - Cole: Sometimes yes. Sometimes problems, buggy communication\n - Tony: don\u2019t you have to do the calibration on each up and down cycle?\n - Cole: should be stored as long as ITSDAQ isn\u2019t restarted?\n - Tony: do we need recalibration warm and cold?\n - Cole: question for ITSDAQ experts\n- Cole: when running AMAC calibration, measured IV doesn\u2019t make sense (either hundreds of nA pre-calibration, or tens of nA post-calibration)\n - Abe: shared current values that were measured at some point and seemed sensible, can check offline\n- Abe to send the procedure for the calibration\n- Luise: low current for the Peltiers seems to work better?\n- Cole: yes. Currently experimenting with asymmetric currents for cooling / heating\nNext meeting: LBNL & Adelaide\n### Outcomes of debugging marathon\n- Carles: how is the connection of the miniDP cables in the coldbox in EC? Done by the feed-through?\n- Peter: yes\n- Tony: what about barrel coldboxes? Plastic?\n- Peter: yes (?)\n- Luise: would like to know whether there\u2019s any change\n- Vitaliy: can use the end metal connector instead of peeling the plastic?\n- Peter: if feed-through connector, OK but difficult if not\n- Vitaliy: At testframe level?\n- Peter: No, you will violate the shield\n- For the testing with FMC-DP\n- Craig: we don\u2019t have a big amount of FMC-DP in hand, but expect 26 soon\n- William: We were going to change these 3 delays. Hold on?\n- Luise: still figuring out the correct way to do it.\n- Tony: (confusion about a different 4th delay)\n - Paul: This is the \u201cdata delay\u201d, the delay in the HCC on the Input Channel inputs, it is also affected by this and needs to be adjusted\n- Initial values were old and arbitrary that worked sometime?\n- Dennis: Craig found one point and I found the other point working the best \n- Phase space discussion:\n- We need to cross check the means of the bits (as in the delay achieved to the bit setting for the 4 delay and the ABC input phase). \n - Ash will probe and check what is needed to keep the relative phases the same.\n- EC frames: collecting feedback on EDMS \n- William: PB testing: PB panels available? R0,1,2 now working and next could come in carrier cards.\n- JJ: during debugging, used a crate. Did you find a problem of not being able to talk with AMAC?\n- Luise: all panels just work. \n- Peter: we didn\u2019t spend time calibrating, so maybe didn\u2019t catch this.\n- Dennis: can write but not read?\n- JJ: only calibration failed. And seems that the calibration changes over time and needs recalibration\n- Ash: version of AMAC?\n- JJ: V2\n- Peter: Steffania reported something similar for the barrel\n- Paul: two issues: 1-loss of communication 2- change in calibration. For 2) how much is changing?\n- JJ: well, the temperature it returns is very high value around 60\u00baC and if I recalibrate it comes back to normal.\n- Nghia: can JJ send the error messages? \n- Dennis: You don\u2019t have same version of AMAC (star and V2) [green vs purple boards?]\n- Luise: please, report to the itdsaq expert list\n- Luise: another burn-in debugging meeting next week or so?\n- Peter: wed/thu next week will meet some experts in UK. We can set a meeting after that.\n### Shunted tests in cold cycling\n- Craig/Ash: leave AMAC on when cooling down and then turn on the DCDC.\n- Ingo: we put on extreme mechanical stress and simulations showed that they can actually break\n- Paul: better control delta T by changing the turn-on\n- Craig: adjust turn-on procedure to avoid big temp gradient. 3 low-power modes released sequentially\n- Paul: we can always use the shunts to ramp up perhaps even more slowly\n- Luise: new command for turning on?\n- Craig: can convert the current command \n- Dennis: the biggest problem is that we need to configure HCC in between to give clock to the ABCs\n- Peter: I need to think about that\n- Peter: what if we emergency power off everything? Risk of breaking modules?\n- Vitaliy: what is the procedure when turning it on regarding HV?\n- Turning LV on, turn HV-switch on, then ramp up.\n- Vitaly: Interlock on sensor current? Yes, ok, interlock fired when problems with the R1?\n- Cole: not in place at the moment\n- To implement in the coldjig software the turn-on sequence. To document in the cold cycling procedures the sequence. In the meantime, circulate which commands are needed to do the sequence manually\n- Andy: discussion in the UK long ago, test first warm. Is it still valid? \u2192 Yes, part of the warm test\n- Craig/Luise: We want to leave the AMAC on when cooling. The question is when ramp down the HV because we want the AMAC being turned off-on. We can ramp the sensor down before cooling or when reaching cold temp. \n- Tony: we\u2019d like in every cycle. Shunted full test, turn shunt off and go to the full cycle. Give comparison of shunted/not shunted for every cycle. Would that be ok? Anything more extreme needed?\n- Luise: if you want to take more data OK, but not standard procedure\n- From chat (Craig):\n - slide 3 here shows a start-up sequence on a module and how that procedure steps in current draw https://indico.cern.ch/event/932643/contributions/3956337/attachments/2078631/3490995/200724_AMAConModules.pdf \n - and slide 4 here shows that my memory is wrong and (at least uncooled on an Al block) the increase and decrease of hybrid NTCs has a similar time constant on the way up as down (at least on old ABC130 modules!) https://indico.cern.ch/event/668881/contributions/2753070/attachments/1542850/2420287/AMAC_PDR.pdf\n- (discussion on how many full tests to run shunted)\n- Luise: need to define a bare minimum. Proposal: at the end of 1st cycle and beginning of last cycle. Can be included in the default testing sequence (putting an option of doing each in easy cycle or minimum). \n- Bruce/Abe: we will need more flags but yes, should be possible.\n### AOB",
