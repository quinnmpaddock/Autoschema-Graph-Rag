Write me your comments, if any. \n- Production of R0 and R1 test frames\n - Australia had questions from their vendor to be answered by Kambiz\n- Production of R2 test frames\n - No questions from companies yet\n- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames\n - Toronto also had questions from their vendor to be answered by Kambiz\n- Production of stencils\n - About half of the stencils are completed\n - Fast shipment will be sent to Canada\n- Production of module frame cover\n - All in transit or in transit preparation\n### EC coldbox update\n- Need help from colleagues for assembly of some items\n - Jig plate assembly (mechanical experience)\n - Cabling (lab electronics experience, soldering, small connectors)\n - Final box assembly (both skill sets needed)\n - Help would be great if it arrived early October for 1-2 weeks, even days\n - Please consider sending trained personnel to DESY to speed up the delivery process \n- List of items will be provided\n - Chillers should already have been procured\n - Ideally also power supplies\n- Please also list info on covid measures in Germany for helping a site to decide if they can send folks\n- Zdenek offered help\n### Sensor visual inspection\n- Hard to find the exact strip\n - Would probably be ok to best effort find the closest strip\n - If not at all possible, mark in overview picture where the defect was seen\n- What about known defects? Can we avoid finding them again?\n- Document should also include the defect types from the sensor group\n- We will likely use the text from the sensors doc in the modules doc and link to the sensors one in some way?\n### Hybrid Glue Weight Tolerance Calculation\n- Craig: We should assume correlation between ASIC glue amounts and such use the \u201cadding tolerances\u201d version (version 2)\n- General agreement\n### Module Metrology EDMS Review\n- Off topic but important - we need to organise a meeting to ensure we have the relevant DB upload scripts in for the metrology (and other items) in the common git repros\n - There will be alternative options, SCIPP has some, Liverpool will provide some, there might be further ones\n- In Appendix of metrology procedure, have a table with hybrid/powerboard thicknesses (one value for each type)\n- Bow:\n - Tilt correct data by fitting a plane and correcting plane to be flat\n - Find your highest point and your lowest point\n - Assume either convex or concave (so far seen to be good assumption)\n - Bow value is difference between highest and lowest point\n - Sign is given by which of highest and lowest is closest to the centre (expectation is one will be at an edge, one will be at the centre)\n### AOB\n- All minutes now visible at:\u000bhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yvCa8qAFvchv2YjjTv6Z9OJ5AieusgtD?usp=sharing",
