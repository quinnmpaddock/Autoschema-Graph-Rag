force curve would be somewhat linear, slope represents modulus, data isn\u2019t good enough to draw curves\n- Sven: would it be possible to repeat measurements for aged samples to see if there is a change over time?\n - Carl: yes, that can be done, already see this effect going from 3 to 5 to 7 days\n - Luise; question about thermal cycling: planning to do these\n - Carl: will come up on later slide\n- Vitaliy: what is the failure mode?\n - Anne: SE4445 usually stays on aluminium and splits off\n- Luise: have you received end-cap material?\n - Hasn\u2019t been sent yet, need to get them end-cap material\n- Luise: how many samples of each do you have?\n - Anne: 3-4 of each\n - Luise: would be good to see how much the samples prepared with the same method vary before comparing different methods\n- Tony: need to discuss Cold Noise modules\n- Tony: need to discuss how long things need to cure before we can use them - overnight was thought to be fine, but may need discussion about how long we need to wait before the interposer can be used\n - Anne: module assembly will already lead to a delay of several days, which would allow for additional cure\n - Tony: would be good to add to procedures\n - Carl: if you are not aware: the only information we have about curing SE4445 is that it should be done at elevated temperatures\n - Tony: it would be a change of the industrial assembly process and the question whether curing is overnight\n - Gerrit: what\u2019s the problem with waiting for a week in production\n- Luise: we know that if you elevate the temperature slightly, curing degree improves a lot, so this could be considered for production\n - Vitaliy: burn-in should take care of it\n - Question whether it is beneficial to have at a defined point in time\n - Can of worms that needs to be discussed later on, if it becomes necessary\n- Luise: for irradiation and thermal cycling\n - Would want thermal cycling done with representative materials to check if it weakens the connection\n - Tony: irradiation: would want to do something similar with parts and coupons\n - Carl: should involve Eric and pixel people, who have irradiated SE4445 a lot and will point out it\u2019s not necessary\n - Luise: if we want this as a production solution, we definitely want irradiations\n - Carl: then we need to discuss with Sandia and schedule - getting into their schedule can be difficult\n - Luise: doesn\u2019t have to be Sandia, can also be different facilities\n - Karol: can offer proton irradiations in Birmingham\n### UK/C cluster speedup plans\nPresenter: Laura Gonella\n- No questions.\n### Discussion: interposers\nPresenters: Luise, Karol Krizka\n- Tony: don\u2019t see how the process works without glass beads - think you need to apply pressure and if you don\u2019t control thickness, it affects coverage\n - Karol: the idea is that the top plate is heavy and applies pressure. Don\u2019t understand concern about spacer. \n - Tony: the glass beads will hold the shape, the stencil won\u2019t - if you don\u2019t use vacuum, you\u2019ll press differently about centre and edges\n - Karol: don\u2019t want to apply too much pressure. Personally see glass beads working better. But Simon is very experienced so want to try the spacers. \n- Luise: have you seen glue squeezing out? How easy to ensure 100% coverage? \n - Karol: have only made the quick and dirty method - glue squeezeout is pretty bad and it\u2019s not very controlled\n - With the production method\n- Luise: my question is mainly about gaps in the spacer. Need to avoid gluing to the base plate? Does it go up over the edges of the flexes?\n - Karol: for us it has been easy to scrape off any excess glue. \n - Luise: Dennis has a less dense pattern to help avoid squeeze-out. \n - Karol: was planning to use the nominal glue pattern, as this is optimised for that thickness and that shape\n - Luise: would be good to see results\n- Geoffrey: any fear of glass beads going where not wanted? Very small and not easy to identify. \n - Karol: don\u2019t have an answer - hope is they will be included in the glue matrix\n - Tony: mixing would happen elsewhere and then beads would be included in the glue\n - Geoffrey: it is a fine powder and can stick to surfaces. \n - Gerrit: good point. Used SE 4445 with glass beads at Berkeley inadvertently, early on. \n - Luise: they were a problem in the past when on the sensor, need to keep the glue and the glass beads away from the sensor\n - Tony: need to keep them separate\nLuise\u2019s slides\n- Dennis: not planning to use vacuum\n - Gerrit: Tom developing a vacuum jig - would love to use this opportunity to make hybrids more flat\n - Luise: balance between needing a good production method and what else we can correct in the process\n - Gerrit: maybe balance in between: could use it to fix the HCC edge\n - Tony: might have to or want to use vacuum to flatten the kapton layer, but even the method pushing down with foam would flatten them\n - Gerrit: 50 um kapton is very flimsy\n - Luise: had wanted to keep an eye on this for different assembly methods - maybe we can compare different methods and flatness afterwards\n - Karol: don\u2019t understand why Dennis prefers vacuum method\n - Dennis: prefer the second method, but without vacuum\n - Karol: okay, everyone prefers second option, but pressure based\n - Dennis: in production, need way more pressure than we currently have. While glue curing, should not have vacuum. \n- Everyone agrees we don\u2019t want vacuum\n- Sven: want to use the plate we use for panel metrology, which has vacuum - need it to stencil glue - but release it after applying glue\n - Gerrit: what is problem with vacuum? \n - Sven: if we get 64 arrays every two weeks, vacuum chucks are difficult to include during production\n- Gerrit and Sven disagree on this point. \n- Pencentage of glass beads we want? \n - Tom uses 0.2% by weight\n - Would like to learn about glue behaviour at edges. \n - Tony: why do we need 100% coverage\n - Vitaliy: would want coverage that is larger than the glue layer under the hybrid\n - Dennis: not even sure if this is strictly necessary\n - [missed what Vitaliy said]\n - Gerrit: if there is floppy 50 um kapton, this will already make everything harder to glue - this will make gluing even worse\n - Tony: would assume 80% or fine and whether it needs to go under all the edges\n - Gerrit: my worry is that our gluing is already critical - the PCBs are not great, but at least they are all the same\n - Dennis: completely clear that everything needs to be reasonably reproducible\n - Dennis: agree with Tony: 80% is much easier than 100%\n - Luise: can we use the current tests in Birmingham to test what a good target coverage is?\n - Karol: yes, will do\n - Dennis: yes, this seems like the way to go\n- Tony: looks like most people are using matching sizes, is that correct?\n - Karol: yes, that\u2019s we started with because it was easiest\n - Dennis: also starting with matching size\n - Dennis and Tony: oversizing makes it hard to realign\n - Dennis: undersizing might be easier later\n - Tony: depends on how we want to align\n - Gerrit: use pins for alignment, can use these\n - Dennis: could also work with undersizing\n - Luise: sounds like we target matching size first, with option investigating whether to go smaller - no intention to go oversize\n- Luise: regarding ESD safety: please keep an eye on charge and check for charge-up\n - Dennis: SE4445 is not conductive either, so it\u2019s not just the kapton we need to check, it\u2019s both",
