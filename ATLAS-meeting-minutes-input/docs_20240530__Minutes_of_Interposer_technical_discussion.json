They do see viscosity changes.\n - Vitaliy: Is there a study with this data\n - Luise: Yes. No proper study, hope we can do one\n#### US Updates:\n- Anne: continuing interposing single powerboard effort\n - Investigating options to maintain holes in powerboards to be used for alignment\n - Luise: any news from Amtech discussions?\n - Anne: getting quotes from Amtech to get the SMD populated arrays out of Amtech, then need to sort out process on LBL side\n#### UK/C Updates:\nContribution from Karol Krizka\n- Karol: do we think the glue oozing out is a problem?\n - Luise: we don\u2019t quite know - would be good to know if it impacts adhesion to True Blue, and we don\u2019t know what happens if it goes onto the sensor - SE4445 on the sensor causes early breakdown, but we don\u2019t know if that is the glue or if the oozing out can cause the same problem\n - Sandra: Tom has seen something similar, it oozes out, but he usually just cleans it up - it\u2019s easy to remove (the glue)\n - Sven: did you see the residue only on the interposer or also on the flex?\n - Sandra: only on the interposer\n- Follow up: does SE4445 residue on bond pads a cause bonding problems,\n- Follow up: does SE4445 residue on interposer cause adhesion problems\n- Aluminum plates too soft on the book press?\n - Karol: Need custom centre inserts anyway\n - Bart: significant impact on cost\n- Bart: RAL continuing at pace (see update from Tuesday), \n - Liverpool also continuing tests\n - Birmingham shown today\n - shear/peel tests need glue mixer (outgassing) to prevent variability in results, hoping to get mixer like Dennis\u2019\n#### End-cap Updates:\n- Luise: use design for R0, R3 hybrids?\n - Ben: working on making these designs as well\n - Pete: excellent, if you have stencil designs, we can try\n - Ben: dxf okay?\n - Pete: perfect\n#### Database setup:\n- Theo: interposer child is a dummy or a real object?\n - Luise: Populate with a dummy, in future attach to arrays anyway\n- No objections against starting like that and refine further when needed\n#### Any other Business\n- Karol: has anyone checked what happens if you try to attach True Blue to SE4445 without an additional interposer?\n - Anne: they just didn\u2019t stick very well\n - Karol: we tried to just attach a blob of SE4445 to a blob of True Blue and they stuck like normal\n - Tom: we stenciled SE4445 onto True Blue and the SE4445 basically just contracted - no wetting, surface tension was terrible\n - Karol: we used big blobs, so different situation\n - Tom: don\u2019t have a picture, but wouldn\u2019t be hard to recreate\n- Bart: glass beads used successfully in US in other contexts but UK doesn\u2019t have this context, would be nice to see the application where it was used in-detector successfully to resolve argument where UK doesn\u2019t see necessity\n - Tom: we\u2019ve been using it extensively on pixels, there is a presentation from SLAC, will dig that up\n - Bart: that would be amazing! Would be good to see for which applications it is useful\n- Luise: residue affecting adhesion or bondability- anyone planning to look into these?\n - Bart: willing but has to come out of something else. Should solve this with the engineering of process\n - Sandra: what kind of test proposing? Deliberately make samples with contamination?\n - Luise: yes put SE4445 on bond pads\n - Tom: cover bond pads, pull SE4445 off them, then wirebond (worst case)\n - Luise: put around bond pads then let creep, but more reliably put directly on bond pads as long as can clean off the SE4445 itself\n - Kirsten: can we agree on whether to clean the pad or not?\n - Kirsten: If doesn\u2019t bond, clean with IPA and try again\n - Luise: Second step of the test\n - LBL will do these tests\n- Bart: suggest topical meeting. SE4445 behavior- adhesion to different surfaces, pressure required different for Al, kapton\n - Luise: after ITk week specific meeting for adhesion\n- Bart: need to agree on a QA/QC programme\n - Luise: discussion at ITk Week\nNext Interposer meeting will be a topical meeting: surface preparation and adhesion",
