Some pre-delivery hybrids are stuffed and work\n- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)\n - Very important to check your import licence status, please make sure you are prepared to receive and send dual use items! (ASICs)\n- Barrel hybrid tendering/order\n - Not known yet if thinflex versions do work (on the way)\n - DuPont continues to be an option, being explored\n- EC hybrids/powerboard tendering\n - Progressing on documents with biweekly meetings\n- Endcap module thermal cycling setup\n - Noone present, moved to next week\n- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation\n - expect to be through in 2 weeks to go ahead with larger order\n- Production of hybrid panel cover\n - Still waiting on company update. Delays due to person shortage.\n- Supply of miscellaneous EC tool common items\n - Shipments to \n - Canada are at Customs/moving\n - Spain/DESY-Z still waiting for RFids to be delivered before shipment\n - Spain can go out end this week\n - Still waiting for bushings\n- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order\n - Need to get populated\n### Powerboard storage document - matters arising\n- We expect not more than ~50 PB panels to have to be stored even at the largest sites. They are stackable. We expect to be able to fit this into all sites dry storage.\n- Will Timon ship \u201cby need amount\u201d or \u201cby box arriving from vendor\u201d\n - Timon would prefer to not repackage and send 50-100 panel sizes, to be broken up/repackaged if sites to not need that much\n- How to schedule reception tests? 30 days? Who tests them when?\n - Example: RAL receives big box with smaller units inside, Craig breaks them apart and re-distributes.\n - If you get a closed box from Craig, the 30 days start to count\n- We will have to learn how long the PB testing will take - re-evaluate current rules/30 days during PreProd\n- Need to look at production flow to get some final numbers on how many powerboards will be shipped to where\n- Should powerboards from different batches be used to get indicators if they work?\n - Might be useful; once they are unpacked this should be easy\n- What to do with reject powerboards\n - Depends on type of reject and quantity\n - They can\u2019t be thrown away. Eventually they have to be disposed off at CERN. This will also be explained in the ASIC handling document.\n- Do we only get good ones?\n - Failed boards should be removed from panels before shipping, but needs to look into this (done by assembly company)\n### Hybrid QC Documents Discussion Summary\n- Andy Blue heroically steps up and volunteers to take over writing / finalising the hybrid reception doc -- Thank you Andy!\n### Hybrid Storage Document - matters arising\n- What happens to items that were (erroneously) exposed to >10% for more than an hour?\n - It is a best practise item\n - If not dry they can change shape, so would have to wait for them to dry out again\n - No catastrophic error foreseen, we should not fail items that have experienced >10% for more than an hour\n - We can flag a hybrid if it experienced this, so we can go back later and find out if we encountered issues\n - Time periods of ~days in cleanroom conditions are probably ok\n- Other question is what happens if storage is bad for longer times in general?\n - Need procedures to ensure that such failures are dealt with / mitigated\n - Don\u2019t open the door any more\n - Get repair team in\n - Find backup solution, e.g. desiccant cartridges\n- Need to make sure there is a flag in the database that can be used if the storage humidity limit was breached\n - With the possibility to add comments to describe what happened.\n- For sensor storage, they should be in a dry storage cabinet\n - Need to make sure the recovery rate and dryness is as specified\n- Add a section about longterm storage of hybrids\n- Do hybrids panels have to be stored covered?\n - Only if one stacks stuff on top or close by?\n - You could put them into a box\n - Again kind of best practise / common sense: protect the bonds :)\n### [moved to next week] Module in Database\n### [moved to next week] R1 tooling update\n### AOB\n- For glass sensor order R3, please make sure the order is in sets\n - Table will be updated and endcap groups will be informed\n- For R4, one sensor for both sides\n- R5, two different designs",
