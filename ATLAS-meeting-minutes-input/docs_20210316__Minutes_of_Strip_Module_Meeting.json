Vitaliy: not sure about most recent panel design, do we have the latest? \n- PCI adapters weren\u2019t distributed yet to the EC but barrel groups should have them\n - All EC adapters shipped to DESY Zeuthen, US parts shipped to BNL\n - When will EC ones be shipped out? No answer, will ask again in next meeting\n- Is there a plan to have a traveling load for the EC? \n - Difficult because very few hybrids available, maybe half a panel available\n - Could it be a barrel panel? Would be better to check setup with endcap hybrids to make sure we don\u2019t overlook any problems\n - Ideally panel should have at least two HCCs \n - Currently panel designs are validated anyway by testing hybrids on them\n - Is it sufficient to send out load with not all ASICs assembled? Not clear, will come back to it\n- Is there any requirement for humidity control during burn in?\n - No, there is enclosure to channel air flow but apart from that it is just exposed to standard cleanroom ambient humidity \n### HV Tab Position on Petal\n- When are module loading sites supposed to cut tabs\n - When removing the module from the test-frame for assembly, the tabs need to be cut in shape (e.g. with scalpel)\n- Pepe suggests to move the cutting line to increase area of tab that can be welded to bus-tape\n - Nobody disagreed\n- Not sure how easy it is to cut the HV tab to the correct size\n - Might help to use pads on test-frame as reference to know where to cut\n- Some tabs are not fully centered\n - Should not change the tool if possible\n - But, might be easy to change bus-tape design\n - Need to make sure first that the module models are correct\n - Models were made by using the tool models\n- Are tabs wire-bonded or wedge-bonded to petal and have there been thermal studies with regards to the long tabs?\n - Only petal at Freiburg with tabs will be tested cold, so will notice if something happens\n - Vitaly: propose to do tests just with tabs\n - Petal HV-tabs will be tab-bonded to petal\n### AOB\n- None",
