Would it be possible to cover that?\n - Navid: Yes\n### Group Update: Birmingham and Glasgow\nPresenter: Katie Walkingshaw Pass\n- Vitaliy: For the unusual IVs, does it make sense to maybe change the module frame? That could help\n - Katie: We\u2019ll give that a go, thanks\n- Peter: For suction cup noise, it\u2019s interesting because we store in dry compressed air as well. And the last three you sent needed treatment. Do you ship them in dry air or N2?\n - K: Dry air\n - Andy: The last 20 modules we\u2019ve seen have had no breakdown or suction cup noise.\n - Bart: A working model would be that the suction cup could rub during transport to build up the extra noise. Deionization or high humidity could cure it. Ultra dry conditions could slow down the charge transfer.\n - Peter? It\u2019s also hard to dry the region under the cups\n - Bart: True\n- Luise: Are you okay with doing all the dicing yourself?\n - Andy: We will have to check, but probably not. \n - Luise: Could you let us know what ratio you would like?\n - Andy: Okay, I\u2019ll get back to you.\n- William: Does anyone here know about the UK DHL? Are these in Pelicases?\n - Andy: Traditionally we send via DHL and things go well, but there was a recent issue where they were shipping the cases without boxes. Some damage occurred. It seemed to have been better than in the past.\n - PWP: The last few from Glasgow were properly packed. Two sensors were rotated to the point where they struck the guide components. Two required rebonding and two screws fell out of them.\n### QT Update: HCC Timing Studies\nPresenter: Lukas Roscher\n- \n- Alex: I tried your gitlab link, but couldn\u2019t access it, could you make that available so other sites can try it? Is it ready for that?\n - Lukas: Right now no, because we are seeing some timeout issues. But in the next week or two, I think it would make sense.\n - Alex: Can you remind me which settings you are scanning.\n - Lukas, Mostly the settings in R32: LCB, RClk, BC, PRLP\n - Alex: From what I understand, we have the 0xee for the Ophase, is this one of the values?\n - Lukas: No, that isn\u2019t included in the scan yet. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s necessary or not yet.\n - Alex: We\u2019ve also had to check that for different modules.\n - Lukas: We\u2019ll see how easy that is to include. For the git, I tried to add all active ATLAS physicists, but I will fix it.\n- William: Thanks for this. On finding islands, I guess this goes to future studies to understand why these gaps show up. But will we find out why there are gaps in these plots?\n - Bruce: On the right plot? The important thing is that it\u2019s a virtual register where you have 2 coarse and 4 fine delays, so this is an artificial gap. \n - William: That\u2019s the kinda thing I want to know.\n - Lukas: Yes, for sure. This is just to get the first working version.\n - William: And then sometimes you get timeouts. You\u2019re on the right track.\n- Luise: I think we don\u2019t currently store the settings in these scans. I was wondering since we are running these scans, I was wondering if we could upload this and possibly pull this from the DB\n - Bruce: We need to figure out what we want. I\u2019m starting to set up a digital test \u201ctest\u201d for the DB. I think it would be possible if this extended that rather than started from scratch. Then we could work out how to integrate it.\n### AOB\n- Tony: Can I confirm what the sequence is we should be trying for the burnin?\n - Cole: It should be 24 hours\n - Peter: We have 20 hours in the non-GUI burnin and 24 in the GUI\n - Cole: Okay, then I need to make sure it\u2019s consistent between the two. I\u2019ll follow up with Ben then.\n- Tony: Can we go to 20 tests then?\n - Cole: Yes\nFrom the Chat",
