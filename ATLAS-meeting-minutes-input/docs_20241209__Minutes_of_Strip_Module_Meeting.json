I\u2019m slightly surprised there are that many sensors there. Is there any attempt to determine the cause?\n - Judith: Not sure, why there is two peaks, it's not from specific institutes so it's not a setup issue\n - Vitaliy: It could be calibration. The relative variation could cause this shift to a higher value. \n - Cole: would be worth checking when the tests were taken.\n- William: My comment was similar. Seems to me that any time you look at the AMAC IVs, they can move by 10-15 nA. My concern is that the RMS as measured by the AMAC might be artificially high. Often the calibrations come up differently. On two of the modules that spiked, spike up and down. On slide 7. I\u2019m not sure what it means to spike down by so much.\n - Cole: the one in the middle is misreads, there was a problem with thread locking where it would measure two instances at the same time. This should now have been fixed by Bruce/peter commonly known as Breter\n - Bruce: There was a thread-locking improvement that was added recently. Presumably this will fix this issue. So that is one process not knowing what the other is doing, and that can cause the configuration to change.\n - Willian: these ones that drop by 50nA I see this but I don\u2019t think this is the module's fault. I wouldn't trust the AMAC to give good data at 50nA\n - Bruce: If anyone can comment on stability using the process locking, that would be good.\n- Cole: slide 8. Concerns could be the top IV and the middle one. The top one is commonly seen before. The middle one shows it goes all the way to 20uA and that doesn't seem right\n - William: I\u2019ve stared at the middle one one 8 for a while.\n - [missing]\n### Introduction\nPresenter: Luise Poley\n- William: I was expecting a ASIC delivery in January, you say they are coming every 3 months, will this be as party of the old shipment plan, or should I be worried\n - Luise: You will get ASICs around February \n - William: February should be fine\n### QCD Corner: Episode 10\nPresenter: Cole Helling\n- Sven: we are doing lots of QC at Liverpool for barrel hybrids already so this doesn't need to happen at other sites.\n- William: we are just picking one hybrid at the beginning of the year and testing it 4 times a year so we are not actually tracking batches\n- Luise: Gerrit? Sites should do this individually, or we should have a monthly thing going. \n - Gerit: the monthly doesn't make sense, you get one hybrid and test it over and over again you are just testing your bonder\nSummary:\n- Agreement to stop testing ASICs and sensors\n- Agreement that current mode of testing old hybrid and powerboard flexes is not useful\n- Agreement that hybrids are already extensively tested and don\u2019t need additional tests at module sites\n- Possibility to make them useful for future tests would need a lot of organising to make sure failed flexes end up in the right places\n- No strong agreement to actually do that, prefer common sense approach where people test flexes as they come in, check, and report\nSummary (not enough note takers today :()\nPeople seem to generally agree we do not need a monthly pull test at every bonding site. The ASIC and Halfmoon substrates are also not really needed for testing, as they are very consistent.\nWhile flexes should be checked for bond quality this is already done in flex QC (would like to verify). Cole will double check on existing QC outside of the monthly pull test and write up the plan. Distribution will be likely in the next week (via email), but might be first thing next year.\n### Group Update: Freiburg\nPresenter: Roland\n- Cole: Will the QT also provide inputs (and use data from) the barrel as well?\n - Roland: Currently not planned, but definitely adaptable. It wasn\u2019t intended originally, so we can use it. \n - Cole:At some point it would be good to ask the barrel and use their analysis script\n- Luise: To follow up on the point in the review, it would be good to understand better why the electrical flexes failed. We want to convince ourselves that this isn\u2019t an issue.\n - Roland: working with an industrial partner is difficult, we are doing our best. We get the failed hybrids so that's good\n- Ewan: Slide 4, the interposers are pushed up against alignment pins. Are these the same alignment pins used for module assembly?\n - Roland: this I don\u2019t know, Dennis is travelling but connected maybe he can comment?\n - Dennis: [inaudible robot sounds]\n - Ewan: If you want to make sure the kapton is properly aligned to the flex, and you rely on that alignment for PB placement, it might be nice if the pins are in the same location. It can move offline, thank you.\n### QT Update: Database Reporting\nPresenter: Chufan Wu\n- No questions\n### AOB\n- Nope",
