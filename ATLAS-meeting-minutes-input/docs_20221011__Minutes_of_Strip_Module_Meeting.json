Not ideal since we don\u2019t know what we are mitigating against and how this will evolve\n - Luise: we see cold noise at one module, so it is a bit on the edge\n - Tony: no, that module was cooled much lower and the shunts were enabled, so there is headroom\n - Luise: we never irradiated the modules, so we don\u2019t know how much headroom we really have\n - Tony: it is less understood than we would like to make a baseline decision\n - Gabriella: it would be good to schedule an irradiation campaign\n - Luise: there is an irradiation campaign soon, but it will likely kill the module so we might not get the data we need. And it\u2019s not clear what glue height we should use for the module we are building\n - Gabriella: if we are considering to use double glue height as baseline, then we should irradiate a module\n - Luise: currently we don\u2019t have irradiations that don\u2019t kill the module at full fluence. We are looking into this (how to irradiate a module to full dose without killing the powerboard)\n - Luise: if we go to double glue thickness and don\u2019t see cold noise, what to we learn from this when it does not have cold noise after irradiation\n - Luise: with a standard glue height module with cold noise, we could get some data on how the cold noise evolves\n- Andy: do we have an understanding on what physics we are allowed to have for cold noise?\n - Luise: if we get it below the S/N ratio of 10:1 we can probably live with it, but at the moment we don\u2019t know\n - Andy: do you know what the allowed cold noise is?\n - Craig: we have numbers of noise at begin of live that are allowed to be at end of life below the threshold. Not knowing the development of cold noise with irradiation, we don\u2019t know what we can accept right now\n - Craig: looking into a quantitative limit, but it is not easy right now and the variability of the peaking between modules is so different that it is not easy\n - Andy: if we do change the glue height or the glue, do we know what we need to reach?\n - Craig: I wouldn\u2019t count all the different options as solutions right now (sylgard). But they will allow us to get an insight into what is going on.\n - Craig: don\u2019t think right now it is possible to write down specifications for acceptable values / a solution\n - Tony: at this point, we just want to figure out what is generating it and understand it.\n - Craig: that is one of the tricky things. A lot of the solutions may not remove the problem, but just reduce the coupling. \n - Vitaliy: there is some light at the end of something though\n - Craig: there are still things that are improving things and we hopefully can get to where we need to be\n - Craig/Luise: there will be a discussion at upgrade week about this\n### Task tracker items\nUpdates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda\nAnd also task tracker for updates\n- 11/10/2022: Barrel\n- 18/10/2022: EC\n- 25/10/2022: Barrel\n- 01/11/2022: EC\n- Single Hybrid Testing Database Implementation\n - \n- Hybrid Burn In Software\n - There are updates, see e-mail to module list\n- Multi Module Test\n - Updates on software, GUI, new version to \n- Modules for Test Beam\n - See introduction\n- Powerboard bending studies\n - Suggestion to move after PRR\n - Zhicai: any \n- Glue Studies\n - Glue tests on halfmoons about to be completed and results expected by Upgrade Week\n### Institute Contributions\n- \nNext week: Freiburg\n### Barrel module tooling order\n- Craig: would be good to start ordering as soon as possible: can we start the procurement process now and only start the actual manufacturing of tools we know won\u2019t change?\n - Sven: would tender for the entire amount, include option for small changes in tender, then have tools produced in order, start production of tools in order\n- Andy: would any of the new glues affect the tools for gluing?\n - Sven: could only affect the stencils and they are outside the normal tooling order\n - Sven: stencil frames are included in the order, there we\u2019d just order a lot of extras\n- Sandra: how do we proceed with procurement, do we need a new review or discussion?\n - Sven: go through the comments on EDMS, produce documents for review and then start review\n - Sandra: will do that for powerboard gluing tools\n### End-cap module testing recommendations\nModule Testing Noise Mitigation Techniques (Graham)\n- JJ: slide 4: ground is also connected to the common shield?\n - Graham: yes, the HV shield is still connected. The LV shield is connected at the test fram\n - JJ: so the miniDP ground is the same?\n - Graham: no, the miniDP is going directly though\n - JJ: if you put them together is there any difference?\n - Graham: no\n- Carles: does anyone know the length of the mini display cable in the cold box for the module jig furthest away? Should we be careful about the length of that cable?\n - Graham: yes, makes sense, could be worth trying if you see high noise\n- JJ: do you ground the chuck?\n - Graham: yes, the chuck is grounded to the LV ground (common ground with test frame)\n - JJ: not high voltage?\n - Graham: high voltage and low voltage ground are both on the frame (depending on test frame version), so should be grounded as well\nGrounding/Shielding and NO Investigation of Prague R2/R4 PPA Modules - upgrade (Peter)\n- Luise: there are a few sites that haven\u2019t started module testing. In process of testing PPA modules we asked sites to summarise their investigations into reducing the noise (that has been seen with the modules). Not all changes are consistent between labs, so sites might have to try different things\n- Carles: for most module sites, they have cold boxes and these are more homogeneous. To compare results, it is safer to test modules in the cold boxes.\n- Carles: point 2 slide 2: how do you do the grounding of the miniDP?\n - Peter: not any special grounding, directly connected from testframe to NEXYS. Alu foil around miniDP cable (not internal grounding)\n - Carles: you made a connection as close to NEXYS as possible and wrap foil around cable\n - Peter: we checked different types of minDP and there was no difference between them\n - Carles: and what is the shield length in point 8?\n - Peter: length of the cable\n - Carles: pont 4 the kapton layers were there for HV isolation (hard anodisation not sufficient).\n - Peter: it\u2019s between test frame and jig\n - Carles: yes, but there are through hole vias of the HV, therefore the Kapton provides isolation\n### AOB",
