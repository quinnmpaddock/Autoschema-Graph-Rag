The only place we can reasonably do it is the big pads and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll catch it here. So I\u2019m not sure what this test can tell us, and it is a lot of effort. We\u2019d want to bond where there is a lot of contamination.\n - Luise: We can discuss this. This is what came out of the discussion last week. The plan is to reduce this as soon as we determine we don\u2019t need it. \n - Tony: Since I don\u2019t know who brought it up, I\u2019m not sure who should speak to it.\n- Sven: What I brought up during ITk week is that we have to do pull tests on arrays after interposer attachment. I agree with the comment that doing this is to verify there is no contamination from creeping oil. It\u2019s difficult. The only pads that are critical are on the power side, which you can\u2019t pull test. And the ASIC lines aren\u2019t indicative if you don\u2019t have a lot of creeping.\n - Tony: I think it will be throwing a lot of effort if it doesn\u2019t tell you anything. \n - Luise: Maybe we postpone this until we know what the assembly process looks like. If there is nothing worrying, we just don\u2019t do it.\n - Sven: We should also separate this from the current pull tests. I think you are saying this is a different kind of pull test.\n - Luise: We should then see how the interposing process works with this and if there is not anything worrying, we drop it.\n- Gerrit (sl. 6): is this live already?\n - Luise: Yes\n - Gerrit: I don\u2019t see it.\n - Luise: That may need an institute authority\n - Gerrit: I\u2019ll check\n - Carles: It works for me\n - Gerrit: This could be useful, but if everyone gets an email and it snows us under, it might be a problem. It might be useful to make this into a bulk email that happens say, once a month.\n - Luise: The problem is that the way this is set up is that it is based on an interval. It\u2019s based on the component type, so we can only set for the test for this component type that it can be every 14 days or once a month\n - Gerrit: So it\u2019s set to component type..\n - Luise: And the test type. \n - Gerrit: In principle, you get an email for components for the test when it isn\u2019t available? [missed some]\n - Sven: I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s each component or a summary. It is triggered by shipments. It\u2019s not triggered by components just sitting at your institute. Luise mentioned that there is a time interval. If you do the test in that interval, you don\u2019t get emails. The DB does send the emails every night once the time interval is reached. You don\u2019t have to subscribe to the email, if you set the flag to off, you don\u2019t get them.\n - Gerrit: I understand, but it would be good if you have a summary at a regular time. That would be really useful.\n - Luise: We don\u2019t know exactly what this will look like. In this list, you\u2019d get the AMAC IV reminder. You can try it and see if it can be useful.\n### L4 Updates: ITSDAQ/Sensors/Documentation\nPresenter: Pavol\n- Cole: The goal is to re-arrange this to make sure everything is in the correct folder?\n - Pavol: yes\n - Carles loves it\nPresenter: Xavi\n- Sefania (sl. 8): Do you really think that if there is a false reading, such as the Cambridge one, should I retake the IV and waste half an hour?\n - Xavi: Why half an hour?\n - Stefania: That\u2019s how long it takes. The algorithm should be able to understand how to skip this.\n - Carles: I agree, this is clearly an outlier and we should remove it.\n - Andy: see this quite a lot when the power supply changes resolution\n - Xavi: From my experience testing sensors from IV, you can see these peaks from time to time. \n - Andy: I think it\u2019s to do with the way the HV supply changes resolution\n - Cole: with the Keithley, it mainly happens at 105 uA, not at a lower range\n - Andy: doesn\u2019t it happen at 20 V?\n - Xavi: don\u2019 think this is related to the power supply\n - Stefania: I\u2019ve seen these false readings a lot, could be many things, but I shouldn\u2019t have to retake it because it\u2019s a perfectly fine IV. \n - Xavi: I\u2019ve taken thousands of them and it\u2019s not something that happens every day. We might be able to improve the algorithm, but it may be difficult. \n - Carles: If it\u2019s just one point, you never stop the IV from that. So for detecting the early breakdown you persist there and test more times on the same point, is that true?\n - Tony: Can we let Emily talk?\n - Emily: I do have, I\u2019m not sure if we reject the AMAC point, but we very well might (or should) and ITSDAQ should reject this point. \n - Cole: this should be done in the software\n - Xavi: yes, you can just remove this point and proceed\n - Carles: If you remove the point from the data file, that\u2019s not uploadable because it lacks points\n - Luise: It doesn\u2019t check the distances between points, so it would just be a gap.\n - Xavi: Just to show these cases, at least for me when I prepare the reports it is confusing because of the incorrect failures.\n- Carles: For the one for IFIC, I\u2019m not sure what happened. We had some problems. For the Noisy IV, it happened to us for some period of time where we accidentally hit the \u201cFilter\u201d button and that caused a noisy readout. \n - Xavi: My suggestion is to not upload this IV.\n - Carles: I\u2019m not referring to IFIC, SFU actually. The one from IFIC is also weird, not sure what to say\n- Luise: The way the process works for most people is taking the IV and using the web app to upload, which has some visualization. If we see the spikes, we can manually edit what we are uploading, so it might be as simple as editing that particular point. For actually modifying the algorithm, we should check with the sensor community since it is similar, and we should keep this consistent.\n - Step 1: Everyone checks individual things\n - Step 2: Then we figure out what to do\n- Emily D: At least one problem with the uploader tool for the HV-tab test failures. In September we fixed that. A few of these are pretty old, and it might be because we were using that tool before the bug fix. It would be good to see the list so we can go and see what the problem is.\n - Xavi: will send the list to check which sensors/modules these are\n- Vitaliy: For Emily, your uploader tool, does it provide visualization and the outcome before upload?\n - Emily: at BNL, use the same code as the common uploader, don\u2019t have visualization, don\u2019t know whether, at BNL, we\u2019d be able to choose\n - Vitaliy: At least I have a code that checks the outcome of the tests before upload. It gives you the outcomes so if something is wrong, you can investigate. Whatever tool you use, it\u2019s a good point that people should check the outcome before uploading to the DB so we aren\u2019t uploading confusing data.\n - Stefania: ITSDAQ does this. When you finish your test, you have a PDF of the tests.\n - Vitaliy: Why are you talking about ITSDAQ, they are tabbed sensors. Do you use ITSDAQ for that?\n - Stefania: Yes\n - Emily: suggestion is probably just to check visualization before uploading\n - Stefania: Okay.\n - Vitaliy: One way or another, looking at the results is necessary before you put things in the DB.\n- Vitaliy: need to follow up about outliers - if we want to remove anything, need to be careful to make sure we don\u2019t fix something actually bad\n- Vitaliy: Some IVs, I agree, most are okay. The one on the top right and the one from IFIC, they look a bit suspicious to me. I wonder if the HV connection is bad (intermittent) - this looks like what the curve looks like when there is an intermittent issue\n- Andy: The DB is filling anything, it\u2019s the analysis code before the DB. \n- Andy: I\u2019d be wary of getting things that are wrong and deleting data when it\u2019s not the sensor's fault.\n - Xavi: What I do is to obtain the parameters before the upload. I think the best we can do is to check what we are obtaining and see there are strange cases.\n - Andy: guessing that a point is bad and a power supply failure might be dangerous\n - Xavi: In this case, I know it\u2019s taking time. To be sure the point of view is to repeat the IV. I know it can take a while, but it\u2019s the only way you can be sure the IV doesn\u2019t really have these outliers. \n### Group Updates: None This Week (Miscommunication)\nDESY-HH Up Next Week\n### QT Report: Barrel Module Tooling Evaluation\nPresenter: Lei Guo\n- No questions\n### AOB\nNada",
