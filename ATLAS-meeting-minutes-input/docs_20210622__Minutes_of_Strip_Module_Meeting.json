-> assume sites can choose to keep QR sticker or move to RFID for the \u201cmitigation frames\u201d)\n - Hybrids will continue to use RFIDs (QR code is not a viable mitigation here)\n### Powerboard site qualification\n- Handovers from PB sites to industry and modules sites well understood?\n - Jacob doc is the \u201chybrid QC\u201d equivalent, does not define the exact test but points to Timons QC doc\n - Also defines what is to be done at reception at module sites\n- PB site QC needs to ensure docs are ready that have all the relevant \u201cQC target parameters\u201d included (you have to know what \u201cgood\u201d means)\n- Warpage? / metrology?\n - Currently in parts as comments in the QC doc, will be addressed\n- Maybe add a visit as well, as we originally planned?\n- Agreement on Timon\u2019s proposal\n - Please finalise QC doc\n - Timon points out roll out of testing system + doc has to also be done asap\n - Then announce ready for review\n- We have to then plan release of parts etc planning\n - Electrical PB reception testing begins to be requirement for module sites only from PPB (we do NOT require el tests of PBs at module sites for PPA)\n - However of course if you have test equipment DO test!\n - Timon would like to test testing equipment at sites, so please always leave at least one PB on the reception panel until able to test PBs\n - Yes, this is also a requirement\n### Task tracker items\nUpdates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda\nAnd also task tracker for updates\n- R2 tool production\n - All parts machined\n - Significant fraction metrologised (hehe)\n - About to send out \u201cfast track/trial order\u201d to anodisation shop\n - This first set will go to Ca following metrology confirmation asap \n - Once trial successful rest of parts will go for anodisation as well\n - Then final metrology\n - Then send out\n - Anodisation expected to take ~one to two weeks\n- R5 tool production\n - most tools in hand at IFIC (registered in DQ and RFID tag attached)\n - found some combinations of tools that don't fit -> look into fixing it\n - other tools be produced in 3 batches\n - powerboard pick-up tool: company not able to assemble them, needs to be done at IFIC (need also check fitting with jigs)\n - Please provide up to date shipping info here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QdbWKPLVTP1uK6mV2fKNJh7lo0UFF-Fhqb8GB_p4pVY/edit#gid=0 \n- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)\n- Barrel hybrid tendering/order\n - Procurement should finally move more in next two weeks\n - Have about 170 thinflex hybrids\n - Will finish QC on them\n - Will attempt to use this set also to qualify material for production as a backup for DuPont\n - SMD scarcity - have sufficient for PPB, will keep a close eye on prod volumes\n - DuPond material for PPB is secured, however for prod we need to keep an eye\n- Powerboard testing setup roll-out\n - Testing of boards that arrived progressing well\n - Will gather list of items required for sites\n - Should be able to have a good idea when it can be sent out in 2 weeks\n- UK/China module thermal cycling setup\n - All UK ColdJigs delivered\n - Sheffield has already tested electronics\n - waiting to hear from other UK institutes\n - IHEP ColdJig\n - Received their chiller from RAL\n - Discovered it was faulty and was sent back for repairs last week\n - In the meantime have quote and delivery estimates for shipping crates\n - 3 crates for \u00a3350 and 3-5 days for delivery\n - once chiller returns (waiting for company to respond with return ETA), we will run end-to-end test before packing equipment for shipping (estimate 1 week)\n - S/W\n - V2 released\n- Production of R0 and R1 test frames\n - Waiting for test with first R0/1 modules\n - These will be the ones in Ca\n - These are for production, so have a bit of lee room\n- Production of R2 test frames\n - See above\n- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames\n - See above\n - Purchase order for R3 and R5 is out, once design verified we give the go ahead\n- Production of hybrid panel cover\n- Production of stencils\n### EDMS Status and PPA\n- What is the next step on the way to make modules? Module loading sites are twitching\n - Modules currently cannot be built until all 26 steps are done\n - We might soon have to mitigate to release modules earlier\n - This would have to be somewhat aligned with the SQ process for module mounting\n- Might make sense to send parts even before sites fully qualified (when they approach qualification) to mitigate shipping delay\n### Wire-bond pull tests in database\n- For numbering\n - ASIC backend, will program one ASIC and replicate, which makes wires start at 1 again\n- Discussion about technical feasibility of implementation for numbering\n - Will have tool (mapping program) to help translate\n- \n### [moved to next week] HV tabbing and SQ requirements\n### [moved to next week] R5 tooling metrology\n### AOB\n-",
