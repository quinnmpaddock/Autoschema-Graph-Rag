Is the only other missing part the 2h leakage current test?\n - Luise: it is not yet in ITSDAQ, but worked on\n - Cole: can do the HV stability, plan to merge the code later this week after some more tests. This is only for single AMAC, need to talk with Bruce about multiple AMAC test\n### Institute Contributions\nUppsala/NOTE update\n- Carles: in production, do you plan for back-up person for bonding?\n - Geoffrey: this is something we need to look into\n- Luise: you said you can start the R1 powerboard tools in 2 weeks. Do you know how long it will take?\n - Geoffrey: no, want to talk with them a bit more to find out the schedule\n- Uli: the R1 tools - in cluster some sites use older version, do you know when the updated tools will arrive?\n - Geoffrey: will have to look into this and will let you know by next week\nNext meeting: Birmingham \n### Hybrid burn in pass/fail criteria\nSlide \n- Luise: are you planning to look at other peoples data as well?\n - Marcus: wasn\u2019t initially planning to do this, but could do it\n - Vitaliy: who else has data that could be used?\n - Luise: Toronto has run burn-in so it would be good to include some EC hybrids as well\n- William: we have been looking at something. If 5 channels in a hybrid fail 15%, should this be marked as failed?\n - Tony: your criteria is 1% for the bad channels, we only saw 4 bad channels at total. You\u2019d have channels from individual run, and then you\u2019d also have cuts on frequency\n - William: would not change the bad channel\n - Tony: you are not failing anything, you are adding to the bad channel\n - Luise: we currently don\u2019t have criteria for what to analyse in burn-in tests. This is what Marcus is currently working on\n - Tony: if you look at the trend plot, they are at the tail. It\u2019s usually gain being slightly higher or lower than usual\n - William: should we basing this on statistical requirements? \n - Vitaliy: based on these data, statistical fluctuations should not affect the results. The point of this criteria is to define cuts for these statistical data\n - Tony: that\u2019s the plan: look at tail and make a judgement call\n - William: eventually we will see a hybrid that fails 15% of tests for 1% of channels, should this hybrid be rejected?\n - Tony: if it\u2019s one in 10,000, you\u2019d want to fail the hybrid\n - Vitaliy: if a channel fails 30% of time, you would suspect a bad channel\n- Vitaliy: something like 10/15% criteria, we don\u2019t need this large amount of runs. With more data, can we shorten the run-time?\n - Tony: no, we should just reduce the number of tests (we are currently running a lot of tests in the 100h interval). Just 1 test/hour\u2026\n - Vitaliy: parameters of test were not derived from data, could maybe consider reducing time and run faster\n - Gerrit: but that violates burn-in criteria: idea was to take out infant mortality\n - Sven: we will probably not catch infant mortality because temperature is too low\n - Sven: we will not reduce the burn-in time with anything we will get from pre-production because of the limited amount of data\n - Luise: yes, we want to look at more data to see what we can get\n- Tony: first 5% of tests have larger fluctuation most likely due to temperature stabilisation\n - Sven: how long did it take to collect the first 5% of data?\n - Tony: five hours, but chopping these out made a difference\n - Ingo: also saw this with 130 chips, sometimes it\u2019s a bit unreliable, even on a temperature regulated cold jig\n - Tony: marcus tried to do media, but this didn\u2019t help\n - William: by how much does it change for the first 5% - that could be a good threshold\n - Tony: what is the gain?\n - Marcus: before, was -0.0011\n - William: if it is twice as large as shown in slide 7, we should pay attention\n - William: the values at 0.5 are the interesting ones, we will not be able to cut on the 0.25 values\n - Luise: analysis looks good, please repeat for more data and more hybrid types\n - Tony: change to 0.5% bins to get a better view\n - Tony: we can also look at per-channel values if people are interesting\n- Luise: do you also plan to include powercycling in your analysis?\n - Tony: we are looking a this\n - Marcus: tests are from January 10th, which includes power cycling on every test\n - Luise: would be interesting to see if there is a difference with or without power cycling\n - Tony: will need to edit Bruce\u2019s code and loop it back in\n- Luise: what you see when the noise goes one way, the gain goes in the other direction. Could you include output noise into your plots, which compensates for this?\n### PSA: in the NIC of Time\nSlide \n- Vitaliy: remember we discussed this topic in the past. The result depends on the kind of card that is used. We even had two cards of the same model and one was fast and the other was not\n - Cole: does this have to do with pre-fetched memory? Related to problem where you think you have the exact same network card, but you don\u2019t\n - Vitaliy: wasn\u2019t clear why, but we swapped the cards and it helped\n - Gerrit: we had the same issue. And there is no clear logic behind this\n - Vitaliy: they are cheap, so swapping is much faster and cheaper than to think\n - Cole: agrees, if other groups see this as well, it is cheap enough to just swap the hardware\n - Luise: for groups, if your tests take 1h, they are too long.\n### End-cap powerboard pickup tool revision\nSlide \n- Luise: said we would do an EDMS review?\n - Marc: have put it on EDMS, but not sure if I can start a review\n - Luise: we can do it. Is 1-2 weeks enough?\n - Marc: depend on peoples time, but should be as fast as possible\n - Luise: do you have dxf of powerboards?\n - Marc: should be somewhere on gitlab\n- Luise: ok, we will assign reviewers. Please complete the review as soon as possible\n### Alternative Glue Trials\n- Kirsten: comment from Peter, thinks sensor was an old mechanical sensor. \n - Vitaliy: should have the correct passivation layer\n - Peter: mix our glue very differently (SCIPP: mixer, TRIUMF: hand-mixing), most likely candidate\n - Vitaliy: we haven\u2019t seen streaking with TrueBlue in this study. We did observe some streaking in the past. There might be batch-to-batch variations or mixing variations\n - Luise: can we find out the batch numbers?\n - Peter: don\u2019t think so\n - Luise: would be good to repeat the test with same parameters to see if this is repeatable. We might have to use glue mixers\n - Peter: yes, can repeat the test\n - Luise: we ordered glue recently\n - Pete: could be older glue\n- Gerrit: congratulations, its a very comprehensive study and important for high throughput sites. Did you tried to poke the streaks to see if it cures?\n - Aware: don\u2019t think so\n - Kirsten: don\u2019t think so either\n - Gerrit: if it hardens at some point, that would be fine, but don\u2019t want wet stuff on the sensor\n - Aware: we still have the samples and can look at them\n - Dennis: if there is streaking on the backside, it would also disqualify it? \n - Gerrit: but there we don\u2019t see it (visuall)\n - Gerrit: would not like to see non-cured glue on surface of sensor\n - Luise: it can collect stuff (dust)\n - Vitaliy: it\u2019s small and not very high\n - Luise: for SE4445, it has a large area coverage\n - Luise: we can do a test and see if we can blow off particles\n - Vitaliy: there will be always particles\n - Vitaliy: don\u2019t disagree, but this should not be a hard criteria\n - Ingo: we should argue, why we would allow this, not why we wouldn\u2019t\n - Vitaliy: we don\u2019t have many options\n- Tony: made modules with True Blue, did we see True Blue seep out under hybrid edges \n - Luise: we have build very few modules with TrueBlue, don\u2019t remember if there is streaking\n - Forest: could see streaking of True Blue coming out\n - Vitaliy: we have seen this on modules (not on all). It was visible (not easily, but with a bit of play it was possible)\n - Tony: made modules in a few places, should look\n - Vitaliy: there might be an effect of mixing. Older modules were hand mixed, newer with machine\n - Tony: probably all in Brookhaven and all need to go on staves\n - Vitaliy: possible to see it, if looking at the right angle\n - Gerrit: we usually don\u2019t take high-res pictures of modules on a stave\n - Gerrit: will have a look at this, but if modules are made to specification there is only very few spots where we could see streaking\n - Luise: every site building modules should look at this and also track the glue\n### AOB\n- Luise: there was an email about purple TrueBlue when opening the package. Not sure if this is visible from just looking at the bi-pack, or only after mixing\n - TrueBlue can expire\n - Have a look for this, it might be important\n- Peter: are there any storage considerations for the glue?\n - Luise: not sure, but will have to check the datasheet\n - Gerrit: all glues can be put into a refrigerator (don\u2019t freeze it) but not sure if this can extend the lifetime. Just don\u2019t do this with SE4445, it does not like this\n - Kirsten: we had 2 different batches of TrueBlue and there we have seen the different colours between the different batches. It did not seem to affect cure time or consistency.\n - Gerrit: but colour, isn\u2019t this just die adde by manufacturer?\n - Luise: that is the question: is it just colour or did the glue change\n - Kirsten: we do squeeze out the bipacks in containers and use glue in the exact ratio\n - Luise: did you see the colour change in the separate components, or only after mixing?\n - Kirsten: it wasn\u2019t visible in the bipack\n - Aware: not sure if the un-mixed components were slightly different, but the mixed glue was\n - Gerrit: did anyone do a chemical analysis to see what causes the colours?\n - Luise: don\u2019t think so",
