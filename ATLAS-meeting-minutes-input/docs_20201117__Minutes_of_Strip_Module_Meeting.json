Lots of back and forth\u2026 \n- We will have to track during preprod to get a better idea if we will build up piles of potentially bad sensors due to humidity effects or not\n - Bake out can usually fix the sensors and we currently expect that rather a large set of sensors will need bake out to recover\n - To be continued\n - Bart;s impression may be skewed due to long timeframe between initial tests and production by HPK - hopefully things will look better when we do not have such long corona induced wait periods\n- Proposal (no one complained): if a sensor is found to have an early-ish breakdown, it is supposed to be stored in dry storage, with us much air exposure as possible, and re-tested every two weeks for two months, if it does not recover, a bake out shall be attempted\n- This is not the plan for production, but a dedicated study to be performed during pre-production to find a protocol to be used during production, specifically:\n - Do sensors with humidity issues experience more problems further down the line and should therefore be baked out straight away\n - What is the recommended dry storage period after seeing a problem\n - What is the yield loss due to humidity issues\n### Concerns with humidity sensors for the cold box\n- Do not use SHT85 for long 0% measurements\n- Better use HYT939 that continues to measure dew point reliably\n### AOB\n- EC noise tests\n - Some modules improved by added low impedance path / DC path\n - R2 did not improve enough (for R2 PB had not yet been glued, but is now, no change)\n - PB specific localised noise is currently not studied\n - PBs are of older type without latest fixes\n - However the HV return path will not be changed on the PB in newer versions\n - Dennis will provide noise plots and list of changes before AUW to module list\n - 20 minute slot to be reserved by Tony for AUW\n- PCI panel power/data adaptor PCBs have been tested at Liverpool. Parts for endcap will be shipped to Freiburg, to be distributed from there.",
