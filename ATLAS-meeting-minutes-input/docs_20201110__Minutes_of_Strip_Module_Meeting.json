The major thing I know about still to be done is smoother integration with the production database. Others should feel free to comment.\n- HV Tab finalisation and production Normal Late\n - Missing comments on updated HV tab version\n - Need experience using this tab\n - Prod has started\n - Finish this task and reawake if we find problems\n- Supply screws and vacuum connectors Urgent In progress\n - Everything is in transit to Freiburg\n - Close task\n- Supply of pins and bushings Urgent In progress\n - Craig W got component list from Marc\n - Criag W will place order ASAP, tomorrow if possible\n### Quick update on UK tools and focus on database registration for tools (Sven)\n- Operator needs to be careful not to slide sensor over positioning pins since they only stick out slightly from the module jig \n- Precision holes were plugged during annodisation, other holes are fully annodised\n### \n### Hybrid Burn-in crate status - PB Replacement and operation with dummy loads (Ash)\n- Vitaliy needs PB carrier assemblies and thinks if he can use the COTS PB from Ash instead\n - Ash thinks the COTS one cannot easily be used outside the hybrid test crate (did I get that right?)\n - The PB shortness will last through PPA\n - Rather tight for next few months, then slightly better for PPA\n - With sites not running full burn in crates we should manage\n - PPB will then see sufficient PBs (depends on when AMAC arrives, plus some time to make the 750 PBs with the new AMAC)\n### AOB\n- Testbeam: there is space for a DUT in the testbeam as petal is unlikely to arrive\n - Petal will very likely not be ready in time any more by this point in time",
