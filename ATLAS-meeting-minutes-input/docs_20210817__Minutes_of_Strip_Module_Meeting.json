Installed rubber gaskets a la IFIC and will send design to other sites\n - In contact with machine workshop to build spares\n - Would be a good time also to do the HCC pocket size adjustment\n- R5 tool production\n - All tools delivered and acknowledged. Close task?\n - Toronto measured and confirmed metrology within 3 microns\n - Will think about this task as \u201cFeedback on R5 tool\u201d from now\n- Barrel hybrid tendering/order\n - Received final quotation for production and going through it now\n - Ash thinks he is approaching the end game\n - Material issue with DuPont remains but are ok for PP\n - Hybrids should be available once prod ASICs arrive\n- Endcap module thermal cycling setup\n - Postponed to talk next week\n- UK/China module thermal cycling setup\n - All UK cold boxes delivered\n - Small upgrades at site have been done\n - Some sites have not yet unboxed, most however have\n - IHEP one: difficulties obtaining crate for shipment, but all is ready to ship once shipment items have arrived\n- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out\n - Received feedback from beta testers about mechanical optimisations\n - Plans for parts are now in workshop, will receive material end of Aug followed by production afterwards\n- Production of hybrid panel cover\n - Aim to ship before end of Aug\n- EC glass dummy sensors\n - R2 Dortmund order is processed by procurement office, waiting for approval (~a week due to holidays) and then order\n - After order expect few weeks before delivery plus shipment\n - R1, R3 from Upsala\n - Will follow up after meeting, company communication was very difficult and stalled several times\n - Company claims customs issues\n - Stuff was paid and company has not delivered for months\n - Richard will also attempt to provide some more pressure\n - Previous orders were provided\n### Module PPA and hybrid electrical test\n- REMINDER: RELEASE OF PPA HYBRID COMPONENTS DOES NOT MEAN THE NON-REQUIRED SQ STEPS CAN BE SKIPPED, METROLOGY, BONDING, ELECTRICAL TESTS STEPS MUST ALL STILL BE DONE!!!!\n- Please use the \u201cFull Test\u201d routine from the ITSDAQ menu as the standard test suite to run on everything (update ITSDAQ if menu item is not available)\n- \u201cFull test\u201d is no longer slow, so the previously faster \u201cconfirmation test\u201d is now in the past :) \n### Barrel powerboards for hybrid panels\n- Storage: keep them in the shipping container in dry storage\n- When groups qualify for PPA parts, they should also request the powerboard carriers\n### Module/Sensor handling recommendations\n- Picking up sensors and modules needs to be done from a grounded surface (tools)\n- Should use the ESD sheets from Hamamatsu to handle sensors as much as possible\n - Otherwise use ESD safe tools\n- Keep a close eye on sensor handling steps, they are a risk to the sensors, so try to reduce after PP\n- If (barrel) module handling tools need to be made from ESD plastik, needs further development\n - Can easily switch between ESD and non-ESD suction cups though\n### AOB\n- All minutes now visible at:\u000bhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yvCa8qAFvchv2YjjTv6Z9OJ5AieusgtD?usp=sharing \n- Craig uploaded metrology json and had to fight changing single quotes to double quotes when using the prod DB upload scripts (double quotes worked)\n - Matthew: you can generate an example on the fly, I can send command. This should be the current and most recent (might be that the example in the document is slightly outdated)\n - We should fix the doc also",
