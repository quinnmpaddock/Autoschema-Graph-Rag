Is AC ready to be added to burn in GUI yet? Most things work well for the barrel, but a mix of endcap types is causing issues. Need to test it out Peter and Bruce will be able to answer more on the use for burn in\n- Will - Does it use the fuse ids or reading the DB records?\n- Cole - It reads the DB, but doesn\u2019t create\n- Tony - From the intro, F/W is being recommended. Should we do this?\n- Cole - Definitely recommend to do this\n- Cole - For 4 R3 in the box issue, there are no specific port requirements with FMC DP. Didn't need the update on the software but just correct CCR codes\n- Will - We got it to work. Thanks to all those involved\n### Institute Contributions: Celestica\nSlides on Electrical Testing:\n- Cole in chat: \u2018I think that is the FMC-DP ADC Calibration\u2019\n- Vitaliy\n - ET readout, except for 1 module others are happy. Ddi you look at the number of bad cons channels? For all of them\n - No\n - I think it would be good to do \n - slide 6 you are showing good module but not clear if it\u2019s really good\n - On slide 4, on RHS youtube R3029? Current looks really low\n - Scales in microamps, others are different\n - Showed data at FT, then some at cold. Were others done cold?\n - No\n - My hypothesis that when IV are dont cold breakdown can change exp with ones with glue on guard ring\n - To clarify 4 of 13 definitely have, some may but no sure\n - On slide 15, different currents when cold, think the rough about is 0 because its cold. If you measure something it indicates something\n - Tony it could be an artefact of the AMAC current?\n - Craig - Can't trust the 0\u2019s but maybe the relative 0\u2019s\n - Craig - Looks like the contact is opening and closing at different temperatures\n - Vitality only if sensor is high when cold\n - Will - we have poked at the HV tab for disconnection but we don\u2019t say anything\n - If HV off when no more than 2000e noise?\n - Tony - Did you test? I thought it was \n - Will thought it was 15,000\n - How is the HV Bond on? Tab bonded to the sensor\n - Tony - Not sure if 0V is different for disconnected for noise\n - Will we can try to set to 0 and check the noise\n - Vitaliy - may have a point. Disconnected will have 0,3v as a built in bias\n - How are the HV tabs connected to the frame? 3 bonds to each \n - Look at both sides of the wb for the hv tabs\n - Will - Does this explain JJ results (slide 12)\n - Cole - Not sure, looks like 2 instance of ITSDAQ talking and 1 is not calibrated\n - Craig - Can look at the ITSDAQ root files scan by scan and see if there is anything funky going on \n - Tony - Bart has plots like this. Anyone else?\n - Tony - if this is HV on and off, it will eventually break the sensors\n - Craig - on slide 8, Bottom RIght CCR 1 is port 1-2 CCR2 is port 3-5\n - \n### Post-cracking module inspection\n- Tony - Glue layer was purposely made 20um thicker\n- No Questions\n### Barrel (Bare) Hybrid Flex QC\n- Sandra - we also found in the US, exp for pull test, with high failure. Ageing tests o the same that failed we get 50% fails\n - Sven - Only want to focus on VI issues\n - Yes but we see correlation with pull test and visual issues\n - Oth\n- Sandra: some defects are really hard to see. If we change the classification, might have to re-do the inspection. Did not see this before\n - Ashley: have been back in touch with manufacturer and wait for their QC report about failure\n - Ashley: most recent batch received last week was good (similar to received circuits in the past). Hope that things are back on track [since they restarted production]\n - Sandra: that is the hope we all have\n- William: haven\u2019t seen barrel coupons, but Freiburg has done a good job in weeding out issues\n - Sven: currently not have the equipment at Liverpool to do images of each defect, but will be recorded in database\n - William: hard to do the re-alignment in the wire bonder, second Sandras comment about better\n- Vitaliy: how do you do the adjustment\n - Sven: easy to do\n - Tony: can be done, but how do you record this\n - Sven: can\u2019t do notification of single wire numbers\n - William: can you just take them aside?\n - Sven: yes, but then we will run out of circuits\n - Tony: it depends on number of circuits and how much time it takes to modify the bond programs\n - Ashely: see what the next batches will be like, but have concern that the 1% defect rate is beyond the manufacturer capability. Randomly distributed issues and keep a unique log of that. At moment don\u2019t see a reason to bin them, they are usable and just require a bit more effort for the wire-bonding\n - Tony: depends on the price of a single circuit\n - Ashley: while we are not at full production rate, we have to see where it goes. Concern is that we pick up issues that we have not reported in the past.\n - Forest: if it is visible on bonder, we avoid this.\n - Forest: we scan through chip positions and wires and avoid visible issues (can\u2019t guarantee that we get all)\n - Ashley: that is similar to what we do here\n - Ashley: issues during pre-production were minimal\n- Forest: need to maintain some level of feedback to manufacturer\n - Forest: for single point pads with plating holes, would be worried about bonding to something that has a defect that could potentially get worse with time\n - Forest: for things that are easily cleaned, hope that this is caught by distribution site and need a mechanism on who is doing the cleaning\n - Forest: it takes more time or more cost, there will be some defects no matter what. We probably have to do some inspection.\n - Forest: for logging, agreeing with taking pictures and interfacing with databases is not easy. Need a simple text code on how to get the information to the wire bonder (we have a paper traveller where issues for the wire-bonder are noted [wire numbers] ).\n - Hybrid Number, chip number, row number, right middle left\n - Forest: need to find a way on how to get data to everyone\n - Sven: can get overview\n - Sven: can highlight the hybrids with issues by putting a permanent-marker dot on the tab with the pull test area\n - Sven: can mark holes on single pads as fail if holes have significant size\n - Forest: will send an example on how we do this. Would be good to have a diagram no how to do the numbering\n- Kirsten: for tracking things, if a blob is spotted and passed with problems and then passed to hybrid assembly site; would like to have some kind of physical marker \n### Introduction\nSlide \n- No comments\n### AOB\n- Marcus gives a very quick update on burn-in\n - Merging script would fail summary test when a single burn-in test failed for whatever reason (e.g. a blip)\n - Made an update in the script for this on the pass/fail criteria of the burn-in test\n - If other people see this (from running Mo\u2019s merging script), please give feedback\n - Tony: Need to fix this before uploading burn-in data to the database before building modules\n - Bruce: would it be sensible to upload it anyway?\n - Tony: can, but can\u2019t be easily fixed afterwards. Right now every single part would be failed\n - Bruce: is it particularly NO or other tests as well?\n - Tony: also other test. Example: trim does not load (response curve fails)",
