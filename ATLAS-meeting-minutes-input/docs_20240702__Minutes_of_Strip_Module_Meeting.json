Dennis had suggested something in a previous meeting. It turns out it was a bondID issue and they fixed it, and now it\u2019s all okay.\n- Call for volunteers, details on slide 6 of the introduction.\n- Tony: Another update. What happened with the LBNL SS module, when they cut out the frame hole, it also opened up the trace to HV. It might be something to watch out for in the future.\n - Luise: We are still looking for a backup just in case.\n - Anne: We will retest today and can likely send it out tomorrow if all goes well. \n - Luise: Let us know then and we will get in touch with DESY.\n- Luise: Slide 8, is everyone happy with this? [asked as \u2018is anyone unhappy with this]\n - No disagreement\n- Tony: I missed the sample discussion for shear and peel and modules. We still don\u2019t have a set number of the Sandia fluences. When \u2026 Do we talk about this here?\n - Luise: I think Carl wants to have an ETA for the modules before he reaches out to Sandia.\n - Tony: He says you have a window.\n - Luise: Let\u2019s talk about this via email and report the outcome on Thursday.\n### L4 Updates\n#### Sensors\nPresenter: Xavi Fernandez-Tejero\n- No questions, all clear\n#### Publications\nPresenter: Hannah\n- No questions, all clear\n### Group Updates: \n#### DESY-Z/HU\nPresenter: Ingo Bloch\n- William: What are you storing on the shelves on slide 4?\n - Ingo: hybrid panels without the pink foam because they have been wire bonded and await burnin\n - William: So you don\u2019t put on pink foam til after they pass burnin?\n - Ingo: we don\u2019t put pink foam on hybrids in general, because we use them for assembly ourselves\n - William: For shipping they have pink for ,we are very careful when doing the burn in. do they sit there for months like this?\n - Ingo: We haven\u2019t built that many modules, but maybe they sat for a week or two? We didn\u2019t have many parts.\n- Ben: Ingo wrote this nice script that converts IVs into json files. I was wondering if it would make sense to add this to ITSDAQ. It seems like it would make sense.\n - Cole: it's a good question\n - Ingo: We try to keep the IV in one place Kenny\u2019s web app, so when the code is changed it gets changed in one place. I took the risk to have to check the code is updated in two places. We could use the same code that kenny uses\n - Luise: I think the problem was the temperature readout when you need to enter it manually. Also ITSDAQ didn't know the size of the sensors. So it's mostly historic\n - Ben: I think it would be worth it to put in jsons in ITSDAQ.\n - Lusie: the dat files are still useful as the temperature is entered manually. The dat files are useful to have a backup of the temperature\n - Ben: Okay, I see the point\n - Ingo: but keeping them means you don\u2019t have to do the analysis\n - Luise: Putting it in ITSDAQ sounds like a good idea, but not to get rid of dat files.\n- Ben: The dat files currently don\u2019t contain the sensor type, right?\n - Luise: it is there in the serial number. You can see.. interrupted\n - Ingo: It\u2019s in the file, but the serial number doesn\u2019t tell you. It will overwrite files.\n - Luise: The name of the file should contain the serial number\n - Ingo: I agree but it doesn't.\n - Kenny: to find the file, you had to navigate to the test, and it has an associated component with it.\n - Ingo: it only says VPX and the number\n - Luise: The file should have the batch number, which should be unique. It should be in there, but the file format should be checked. If you correctly set both numbers, it shouldn\u2019t overwrite the files.\n - Ingo: so we have to put the batch number. That's the solution.\n#### DESY Hamburg\nPresenter: Serhat Ordek\n- Luise: Would you like an exchange about wire bond loop shapes for your frame bonds to prevent breaking during cycling?\n - Serhat: it\u2019s not only modules built in Hamburg\n - Christian: also happens on modules we get from other sites; adjusted parameters locally and we should be okay now\n- Xavi: About the R4/5 that are failing the IVs. Did you try to deionize them?\n - Christian: Yes. We also had them in dry storage for one or two weeks. So far, it hasn\u2019t resolved the situation\n### EndCap Hybrid (ASIC) Metrology \u2013 Selection Criteria\nPresenter Ewan Hill\n- Sven: regarding the slide about changing the glue pattern. You ignored the case of the hybrid being within spec or at the top of the package height. You can push more glue out to the edge, near the guard ring, which isn\u2019t a solution that can work.\n - Ewan: The exact specifics of the designs i will have to lease to william and bob I can imagine getting close to the guard band is a problem\n - William: I think if the package height is too high it sits flush. But it can sit wrong and you get too much/too little\n - Sven: your stencil will sit flush in any case if you increase the amount of glue by modifying the pattern you will just squash the glue outwards more because you have more glue\n - William; I agree and we are removing the small dots because they are causing cracks. So we are working on how to get good support without those. In the case where the package height is too high, we are okay. When it\u2019s too low we have an uncontrolled amount of glue.\n- Luise: My question is about two cases: hybrid bending up during assembly and the other is bending up during metrology. If it happens during assembly, then the package height and glue height \u2026. [mixed sentence, sorry]\n - Ewan: the are generally correlated the glue height package height sometimes its higher sometimes its lower depending on the situation \n - Luise: Looking at your backup slide with the correlation plots, it looks like it isn\u2019t too bad. The glue and package heights correlate well.\n - Ewan: depending on the situation ABCs tend to follow the line, the HCCs tend to not follow the line. Generally the distribution varies.\n - Luise: to me it looks like it\u2019s a good correlation save for a few outliers. For HCC there are more\n - William: There are some flags that cause outliers. I think we could sacrifice those four that don\u2019t fit.\n - Luise: so if they both correlate it does mean that the package and glue height agree pretty well \n - William: It\u2019s inside the pick-and-place machine, which we can\u2019t look at at Celestica. It\u2019s the way the machine works, it\u2019s not accessible. We can do it once or twice to make sure they are flat, but it\u2019s not a production solution.\n - Luise: This means its a problem during gluing the glue height is too low\n - Ewan: Yes, the glue height is usually too low. And it\u2019s happening during gluing. \n - Tony: The flag is up, that\u2019s what is causing it.\n - Luise: Yes, it\u2019s not just a problem of metrology. But if the glue height really is too low, that is a problem\n - Laurelle: WHen doing metrology you can see the problem there.. Couldn't hear\n - William: It\u2019s the flexes that we can\u2019t flatten that cause the glue to be too thin and the package height to be too low.\n - Luise: this is a problem with the assembly process either the hybrid is too bend or there is a problem with the jig\n - William: It indicates the flexes aren\u2019t flat enough to assemble. It\u2019s almost impossible. We are trying to expect as many as possible, but there isn\u2019t a reliable way to do this\n - William: We may spot it ahead of time, but it\u2019s still a large number that we are seeing with this problem.\n - Geoffrey (sl. 36): The hybrids are flexing you have right angles. If you press the tab at the top it seems it's a full metallic bit, retracting itself. That corner \u2018pointing at hybrid ear\u2019 that point is also sticking up. Even with the vacuum, it\u2019s still sticking up \n - Luise: So you are saying it\u2019s an intrinsic issue that can\u2019t easily be fixed?\n - Geoffrey: Geoffrey: We can't fix it we have tried more vacuum the other solution is tape but that's not going to happen with 7k hybrids\n - William: It\u2019s a tradeoff on flexibility.\n - Ewam: you can\u2019t really bend things back into shape if they are originally not flat to begin with\n- Tony: The argument is really about what is acceptable - the cuts we set up for ABC are relatively soft and they were mostly done for barrel data. Loosening them by 5 um is not a problem. The question is on the flag of the hybrid, what is the risk if the flag bends up too much and then the temperature would be too high, but the lateral heat spread is actually very good. The other question is bond support, and whether it would be good enough. And then the question is - have any of them built into modules and do they behave well?\n - William: We are going to look. But there aren\u2019t many things that have been made into modules. We could get lucky. We can glue on glass, but finding these is sort of \u201clucky\u201d, can\u2019t arrange for it ahead of time. \n - Tony: there's also the whole aspect with interposers how your going to get it down\n - William: Once we get to interposers, it\u2019s a completely new discussion.\n - Luise: we should check how many of these have been built into modules. I agree with Tony, about the concerns. We should check what has been built\n - William: there is a chance that there are one or two out there (or not). On slide 16, we decided to send ten of these out. We will pass these with problems. In order to check more, we\u2019ll need to send these out.\n - Luise: we can try sending them to places where they are going to be built. We should try make this happen at a higher rate\n - William: We should put a higher priority on making modules with these.\n - Luise: agrees\n - Ingo: should we maybe build them on \n - Luise: these should be good hybrids. So we should use them on normal sensors.\n - William: And we may eventually crack these (going to use them on cracking studies)\n - Ewan: somewhat depends on the breakdown on when they are failing some flavors fail differently you won't just build R5s\n- Tony: you don't need to increase the cut in both directions - you can make it an asymmetric plot\n - Ewan: I haven\u2019t looked in either direction. For package heights it can be either higher or lower, for glue, it is usually just lower.\n - Tony: You should check it from your correlation plots. I can't see it there or in your distribution. What you see, you can\u2019t have a high side tail.\n - Ewan: high-side package or glue height?\n - Tony: You can\u2019t have either.\n - Ewan: When not held down, it could produce larger package heights.\n - Tony: That means the vacuum is worse.\n - Ewan: yes, it's mostly on the low end\n - Tony: The low end is motivated by what you are seeing. If you have it stuck down in the pick and place vs what's measured in the Keyence \n - Ewan: I can do those studies to see what the change is. Is there a knock-on effect?\n - Tony: If you make it the high end, you can bottom out and have squeeze-out. Having it shove glue everywhere (when thicker) is bad.\n - Luise: We want to increase on side where it\u2019s truly necessary, not just symmetric because we have done symmetric \n - William: I agree, we are too close to the numbers. We will see what the numbers are.\n - Ewan: we can also study +10 vs +20 \n- Sven: Do you have an idea why where the ABCs are, the height is better controlled?\n - Ewan: I haven\u2019t studied it. For the most part it is flat. But occasionally, it\u2019s not just the flag but some warping happens under the ABCS. Then the whole hybrid has several failed ABCs.\n - Sven: but that would affect your glue height, it's controlled by your pick and place. Your glue height is narrower than your package height for the ABCs\n - Ewan: haven't looked into the exact causes here for ABC, need to investigate more\n - William: That\u2019s the way we designed it. Some of these hybrids, like this, has some bending in the HCC region. There is too much copper to take that out.\n - Sven: but that should only affect the package height, not the glue height\n - William: The vacuum can\u2019t suck it down in this region, so there is a bump that causes the ABC height for one or two to be too high.\n - Sven: that can\u2019t work, the package height is controlled by the machine, the hybrid will not affect the total package height. That's why I don't understand this for the ABCs\n - Laurelle: Package height can also end up too low from just moving around the hybrid/jig \n - William: So they are assembled on this silver jig on slide 7. \n - Sven: Then if I look at your package height histogram, there are very few that hit the low bound, and more on the high side. Which is a setup issue rather than a measurement issue.\n - William: It is on the high side, we\u2019ll have to think about it more. They aren\u2019t as flat as we hoped.\n- Luise: ABC glue heights a lot. For good performance, we don\u2019t need to worry about very narrow cuts. We should not make the argument that too many fail, so we need to loosen. Rather, we should show that loosening the cuts does not affect quality. Where do we need to set the cut to have viable products? \n - William: I agree. Just because we want lower failures doesn\u2019t mean we can just adjust the criteria. We\u2019ll look into this more.\n- Luise: Would be good to know what the failures look like. If you have a vacuum fail, what does it look like in the data? \n - William: You can see them in the correlation plots. Something badly went wrong with those outliers. The problem is half of those that break the correlation are within the correlation, the other half are outside.\n - Ewan: We have plots of regular failures, not just one-offs.\n### EndCap Module Glue Pattern Updates\nPresenter: Luise Poley\n- Ingo: Can you quantify what the improvement is?\n - Luise: I am hesitant to compare these numbers.\n - Ingo: that\u2019s what I meant, the relative improvement.\n - Luise: From the right to left side, it doesn\u2019t matter much with SE4445. For Hysol, it matters much more.\n - Ingo: so 30 percent more improvement \n - Luise: yes, there is a definite improvement\n- Sarah: When you say, full coverage, do you really mean full coverage? What about not interrupting the lines?\n - Luise: You mean for modules?\n - Sarah: Yes\n - Luise: We never got that simulation. We have full coverage and for blobs. Full lines are essentially equal to full coverage.\n - Sarah: Are we going to simulate that?\n - Luise: The question is if it is an advantage.\n - Sarah: Sure, if we are happy without the blobs.\n - Luise: There is a plan to build a module with continuous lines. So we will soon have data \n - Ingo: The task is then not to make continuous lines but include the support where the blobs are?\n - Luise: For now, the most important thing is to avoid the little dots.\n - Ingo: We made them for a reason, it is for bond support.\n - Luise: yes I think we also have this problem where the glue process isn't under good control, The question is the bonding support good without. If this improves cracking is the first question the we will worry about the bond support\n - Sarah: We are planning on pulling the lines out\n - Ingo: I think that\u2019s what we want to do as well.\n - Ben: We replaced the small dots by extending the lines or widening the lines. The benefit of continuous lines is that it lets us keep the same stencil thickness. An opening under a cm wide gives us a more even deposition of glue. I would support studies with long continuous lines.\n - Luise: We\u2019ll ask the sim people. We don\u2019t want to change too many things at the same time or we\u2019ll confuse ourselves.\n- Carles: THe comparison shown between se4445 and Hysol these are without interposers. For the modules with the interposer modules we can still use the stencil with glue dots?\n - Luise: This is for versions without interposers\n### AOB\n- Nope",
