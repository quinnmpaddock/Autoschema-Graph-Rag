Probably since first design was rejected by community\n - Any shipping tests done? No, but no different results expected compared to initial design\n - Video shows boxes that are not wrapped in ESD bags and has shock sensors attached, this is where problems arose in the past\n - Have to do this test!\n - Question: no x-y restriction in new design, wouldn\u2019t that pose a risk? Christian was trying to get the modules to move by dropping etc but so far no problem seen\n - Could add more foam to both sides of the modules, would increase price but could be done if we see problem\n- R4 tool production Urgent In progress\n - So far no change request from running EDMS of R4 2d drawings\n - Please reviewers have a look and approve/comment\n- R5 tool production Urgent In progress\n - Tynan rejected the R5 tool 2d drawings\n - Requested changes will be implemented by tomorrow and we do another very short review\n- UK/China powerboard tool production Normal In progress\n - No updates from the running production\n - Expect about 2 weeks till notice\n- Barrel PPA hybrid order Urgent Late\n - Gone out for quotation\n - Not expecting quote until beginning of November\n - Will update again in two weeks\n- EC PPA/prototype hybrid order Urgent Late\n - Order went out, not sure if W\u00fcrth confirmed yet\n - Don\u2019t know when Kambiz is back, will put it on agenda again for next week\n- Barrel hybrid tendering/order Urgent In progress\n - Quotes expected beginning of November\n- Powerboard testing setup roll-out Urgent In progress\n - USCS still trying out setup\n - One will be send to RAL soon\n - Freiburg has one\n - Travelling DAQ load available early next year\n - Concern that only Freiburg will have one in EC, any spare active boards available? No, need all for test of crate\n - Next update? In a month\n- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation Urgent Late\n - See slides later\n- EC module test frame finalisation Urgent Late\n - See slides later\n- Finalisation of barrel hybrid panel Normal Late\n - Transferred 6 hybrids to test panel and could read all\n - RFid works as well\n- Barrel module testframe finalisation Normal Late\n - No change since last update\n - Bart about to build a module on one of the new test frames\n - Frame works, but was unlucky with the module (powerboard blew up)\n - Bart investigate what went wrong and will report back\n- DB readiness / doc Low Late\n - finished\n- EC hybrid panel transport box finalisation Normal Late\n - Please provide feedback on EDMS review\n - If no more findings then only minor revisions till final\n- EC single module transport box finalisation Normal Late\n - Please provide feedback on EDMS review\n - If no more findings then no further revisions till final\n - Need to see location of screws etc, which should be included in the two assemblies that Marc has uploaded\n - Let Marc know if that is not sufficient\n- Barrel hybrid panel transport box finalisation Normal In progress\n - Basically final, will discuss internally in the Uk if it can be marked as done\n### EC testing frames\n- Result of discussion:\n - Changing blind via to through vias is accepted\n - Covering the back with a solder mask is not recommended for thermal reasons\n### Documentation status / plans for the EDMS reviews\n- Readiness is better than 50%\n- Keep xxx for EC hybrid thickness throughout review and fill correct number once we know EC hybrid producer\n - Keep a list of things that are unknown so far\n### Single module testing at LBNL\n- Is there a connection to earth somewhere in the setup? \n - Not clear\n- Might need proper ground connection for Nexys to improve results (as shown in testbeam)\n- Craig to try and draw sketch of best practise connection\n- How was glue applied? Stencil, want to switch to robot for production, not yet done \n- Should ground chuck to frame because it\u2019s known to help with noise\n- Have to add recommendations for best practice to electrical testing QC document\n### AOB\n- \n-",
