Then the IV test results become weird/questionable. Maybe also noise results might be affected\n - Peter: two DESY modules at DESY did not show problem, so no pinholes? (ist das was er gesagt hat?)\n - Vitaliy: would still prefer test to be done, effect on AMAC IV is the only effect measurable after irradiation, because we need to know this\n - Peter: have a module with a couple dozen artificial pinholes on it\nITSDAQ Update\n- Tony: the other thing we need is the merging script and what we want to do for the cold cycle upload\n - Cole: rumour has it that someone from US has uploaded it to the database\n - Tony: yes, for burnin it is easy; but for thermal cycling there are additional test data that need to be uploaded\n - Bruce: try to work out burn-in first\n - Bruce: there was an update last week or so which should fix the merger script for burn-in data\n - Sven: can confirm that it works (with the test type name)\n - Bruce: there were two merge requests in parallel\n - Tony: for the cold box, there is an open discussion of what we want to do/upload and what to merge\n - Cole: procedure is sorted out and being implemented, finalising procedure in datavase\n - Tony: we have 4 IVs, do we upload all of them individually or merge them somehow with the cold test data, \u2026\n - Bruce: don\u2019t think there is something wrong with this\n - Tony: depends on how the data analysis is done (and how people later want to access the data)\n - Luise: Mo is also volunteering to help, so we should start an email discussion\n - Tony: also need to keep the run-number issue in mind [manual runs on several days]\n - Luise: for merging, most of it is easy?\n - AMAC IVs can be uploaded individual\n - Open question about merging cold and warm individually\n - Tony: for individual IVs you would have to pull them by timestamp\n - Luise: or use a comment\n - Tony: there are different ways, just need to converge to a common method\n### End-cap powerboard testing instructions\nSlide \n- Cole: R2 doesn\u2019t need inversion - but it should, right?\n - Ben: maybe I got this wrong\n - Cole: R2 does need the conversion, I\u2019m fairly sure\n - Dennis: R2 is similar to R3, R4, & R5\n- Roland: page 15, serial numbers won\u2019t be on the shield box, but they will have a serial number sticker on them\n - Ben: will add that\n- Luise: for database question, do you want to start and email thread to discuss this?\n - Ben: already started an email thread a while ago. Need to follow this up again\n - Luise: maybe also talk with Dennis/Karol to see how barrel has done this\n - Dennis will add other people that need to be added\n- William: question about slide 15: is it the serial number that goes into these boxes or the ID that should go into these boxes\n - Dennis: should be 28\n - Dennis: EC powerboard only have 28 on shieldbox. But on carrier next to powerboard is the full serial number on a sticker\n - William: is there a full database record of the panel? Do we really need to fill in all powerboards by hand?\n - Ben: yes, can just enter the panel number and then it will fill all the needed information automatically\n - William: that would be great\n - Ben: not sure if it works with the powerboard type yet\n - Dennis: for EC you can put in the ATLAS serial number of the carrier. They also have a QR code with the serial number. This has the powerboard type encoded and would be the most convenient type to do\n - Ben: need to add this\n - Dennis: just use the QR handreader.\n - William: does the Z-turn recognize the QR reader?\n - Dennis: the interface is a web interface on the computer (not the z-turn)\n - Ben: Dennis: could you test it with the serial number of the carrier?\n - Dennis: yes, can also send serial numbers which work\n### Endcap Module Metrology: R0-R5. Preliminary analysis before PRR\nSlide 14\n- Ewan: do we do any metrology on powerboards after assembly?\n - Dennis: on all recent industry assembled powerboards there will be a pass/fail\n - Ewan: where?\n - Dennis: done in Freiburg when they come back from industry\n- Dennis: can comment that newer flexes are also hand populated so flatness is not indicative to industry populated flexes\n - Luise: Only R4 & R5 are industry populated (latest non-cuvred)\n - Luise: maybe for new ones, could you add a comment that they were populated in industry?\n - Dennis: yes, can do\n - Ewan: (slide 14) outlier is an R4.\n - Dennis: but even if they were industry populated, the shieldbox was not\n- Pavol: measure all R2 and R4 powerboards before mounting - can send you Prague data if you like for pre/post gluing comparison\n - Ewan: that would be great. \n - Pavol: can confirm that flatness of powerboards is not good and flex height has a large variation\n- Pavol: when we have industry populated powerboards, can we reject powerboards which are out of spec?\n - Dennis: not many. It is just following the yield table and we will produce this\n - Dennis: the idea is that for every started module there will be a powerboard distributed and we hope the that the yield for SMD population and assembly are fine\n - Pavol: and if powerboard is too bad to make a module, should we send it back?\n - Dennis: there is a yield for powerboard production, so we hope it will be covered by this\n - Pavol: okay\n - Dennis: also, QC so far wasn\u2019t good enough \n- I\n- William: surely we don\u2019t have <100um tolerance on petals. Where does the cut come from?\n - Luise: envelope comes from EC loading site.\n - Ingo: this is the upper limit. There is no room there\n - Dennis: insertion is reasonably tight\n - Luise: this is supposed to be a hard cut and with new tools/powerboards we should be able to hit this\n - Ewan: more details on documentation would be good. For barrel the tolerance is based on build-up from known tolerances\n- Luise (PRR related comment): would be good to mark which of those were good and which are out of spec based on old tools and powerboard types\n - Ewan: this is not a draft for the PRR talk\n - Luise: hopefully we can get more data for the PRR\n- I\nSlide 3\n- Luise: from database it is not possible to say if the powerboards have the larger coils or not\n - Dennis: all flexes V4.x have the larger coils\nSecond set of slides form Laurelle postponed to next week\n### AOB\n-",
