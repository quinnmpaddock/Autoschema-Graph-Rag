Might need a template to help with the screwing\n - Marc: there are some additional holes in test panel and plexiglas to help with alignment\n - William: will have to look into developing a tool to do the hybrid panel assembly\n- Jonas: what about pushing on areas of hybrids that have no sensitive bits?\n - Close to ASIC backside, not recommended\n- Karola: what about shipping sensors with HV bonds?\n - Dennis: can custom-make foam for this case \u2192 yes please for Toronto\n - Jonas: probably also for Upsala\n- Jonas: when can we get module test frames?\n - Dennis: send email to Freiburg to ask for them\n- Ashley: who does brass inserts?\n - Dennis: population done in house for this batch. For production should be done by responsible institute.\n- Is there a plan to have the 1MOhm on the frames?\n - Dennis: depending on how institutes do it during pre-production, will need feedback\n - Craig: worried about having to choose correct cable when switching between sensor and module testing\n - Dennis: not sure if it is a problem if it is in series for the module testing, since there is already a 10MOhm resistor, but need to be aware of the voltage loss in the resistor\u000bWould only be an issue with the single module test setup, not with the coldbox\n### Pull testing document discussion\n- Simon: has anyone struggled to get the 30Degrees\n - Karola: it was hard to show in the pictures that +/-2 is hard to prove\n - Simon: should be able to get something acceptable without tricks; it\u2019s all about trust and good feedback\n- Gerit: Forest, in your experience how far is the angle influenced by different wedges (e.g. new wedge)?\n - Forest: haven\u2019t looked into it, but my feeling is that it doesn\u2019t change; certainly haven\u2019t seen any noticeable variations between wedges used so far\n- Tony: if we target a correct value, the uncertainties will add to it, so we should monitor it\n - Forest: should be good to periodically take pictures\n- Bart: Why don\u2019t we have to do this during production? Could do it at end of life of a wedge.\n - Tony: need to get some experience to get a handle on it\n- Bart: have experienced some variability in Chicorel cards lately\n - Forest: realities of life; only burned through one pack of cards in years and they were good\u000bThis is a good example why we can\u2019t say that parameters stay always the same.\n - Kirsten: shipped cards to Scandinavia and US; tested before shipment and they were good\n - Bart: some new cards from manufacturer were also bad\n - Tony: looks like there is something wrong with the standard candle at the moment; at some point everyone should be able to pull 11/12g otherwise this would indicate the parameters or something else is wrong\n - Bart: don\u2019t assume at the moment that the Cicorel cards are the best \n - Tony: cicorel cards and sensors should be best, other objects should show less pull strength due to how they are produced\n - Bart: sensor is a very good indicator\n - Gerit: should not move away from Cicorel, since this is used by Hesse\n - Tony: for SQ people should move on to sensors if they are waiting for good cicorel cards\n- Forest: can we all agree to go back to +/-2 Degrees?\n - Bart: agrees\n - Gerit: agrees\n - Forest: agrees\n - Simon: agrees\n - William: didn\u2019t object to 5Degrees, will talk with company that does the bonding\n - Marc: 2 Degrees are fine\n - How strict are we with pictures not being perfectly perpendicular\n- Forest: in some pictures have seen reflection of look on substrate -> picture angled\u000bGroups should try to get it as good as possible\nDecision: changing angle variation back to +/-2 Degrees\n### AOB\n- no",
