Will add this to the slides\n- William: build all hybrids in panels and can test all of them. \n- William: looked at R3 module frame, and the noise looks worse\n - Luise: issue there is to know if this is caused by the powerboard. Would like to re-do it with the new powerboards\n - William: OK\n - Dennis: do you already test with the green R3 hybrid panels?\n - William: yes, they work but some traces are too narrow (as already discussed with you)\n - JJ: did not test with R5\n- Luise: do we need any more tests, or can we start the review?\n - Dennis: would like to test the phasespace to see if there are changes\n - William: have shipped the R5 already away\nSlide 7\n- Bruce: same thing on barrel, will just not flag errors and put data the wrong way around\n - Dannis: might be different between FMC-IB an FMC-DP, but not obvious why\n - Luise: if you are not mapping correctly, you noise might be higher\n - Craig: as sanity check could also use AMAC to only turn one one hybrid\n - Bruce: there is also an ABC-ID check in ITSDAQ, but not a default\n - Dennis: in EC all HCC have bonded IDs, so can clearly see which one is where\n - Luise: should use new powerboards to confirm the mapping.\n - Peter: is supposed to be the same by design. Don\u2019t know why there is the difference between the readout boards\n - Craig: would have noticed this with single HCC modules (LS).\n - Luise: might also mix different test-frame versions, module frame version, \u2026\n - Dennis: this stuff was stable between all of them\nSlide 10\n- Tony: if people were following this scheme, should people update their procedures?\n- Sven: don\u2019t expect people to retro-actively change the results, but going forward people should update this \n- Bruce: this also comes into the electrical tests and from generating configs automatically.\nSlide 12\n- Carles: how were the numbers calculated?\n - Luise: numbers take into account how much of the strips are covered for nominal. \n### Institute Contributions\nNext week: Upsala\n### Module metrology follow-up\nSlide 5\n- Vitaliy: Do we need to ask the stave/integration people about any issues/limits here?\n - Luise: sure, we could use their input\n - Craig: the number in the metrology document is the current best limit that we got from the people\n - Gerrit: we are looking at stackups and clearances right now and probably discuss it in the loading meeting tomorrow\n- Ingo: for EC, this was also driven by first (or second) disk where the design has some constraints\nSlide 6\n- Ingo: missing the definition where something is measured\n - Ingo: under ABC is just where we measure\n - Luise: only care about average glue height under ABCs\nSlide 7\n- Tony: will look at plots for noise, but don\u2019t think we have a hybrid with very low glue height\n - Gerrit: think we had a couple of vacuum failures over the last year and will look at that\n - Tony: don\u2019t have this in the database so far\n - Tony: only recall one hybrid with failed vacuum in the database\n- Tony: could we have a table with the limits: pass, pass with problems, \u2026\n- Tony: for X we haven\u2019t decided on a final number?\n - Luise: have to look at EC for sensor overhang before we can decide between 200 and 300\n### Hybrid metrology descoping\n- Sven: may need lower limit on glue height due to UV curing, otherwise curing won\u2019t work\n - Luise; what should that be?\n - Luise: 60?\n - Tony: the ones below 60 where we had vacuum failure and they had vacuum leaks. They should not be used in the long term\n - Tony: should 60 be the average or individual chips\n - Luise: propose to have a limit from 60 to 160 for each ASIC individually, and also look at the total package height\n - Laura: for lower limit not accept this, for higher glue height can look at total package height\n - William: concerned about HCC areas: might be more related to uneven hybrids than actual HCC glue heights\n - Laura: if glue below 60, reject\n - Gerrit: if glue is below 60, the glue will also start seeping out onto the bond pads\n - William: when we do metrology, we struggle to get the glue thickness correct if the hybrid flex is particularly \u201cwrinkly\u201d\n - Laura: HCCs from Toronto are most of the time above 120, so low glue height not very worrying, only concern is about ABCs, but they\u2019re fine\n - \n- Ingo: would be good to check some cases where hybrids are high to look at ASIC temperature\n - Tony: you never see that\n- Ewan: did we officially change from 100 to 200, or was that just the barrel?\n - Luise: last plots were only for the barrel, so wanted to check the EC hybrids as well.\n - Laura: they are most of the time between +/-100\n - William: using +/-200 will help (it is very time consuming to get the pick-and place to the exact target)\n - Pavol: is there an issue with the tools?\n - Sven: the tools have enough clearance to allow this\n - Ingo: and if the tools smash the wire-bonds, they would fail the electrical test\n- If it glue is >160, but total package height is within specification, test passes\n- If 60 < glue height < 160: pass\n- If glue is <60, fail\n### UofT hybrid metrology update\n- Ewan: new DB upload tools have plotting, which will help catching those issues earlier\n### End-cap tooling conflicts with hybrids and powerboards\nSlide 3\n- Carles: we already cut a different pedestal on the tool. Maybe this is not a problem any more?\n - Mark: can check again and this was the obvious issue.\n- Luise: is this for all design variants?\n - Mark: yes.\n - Luise: still have some time before the new powerboards arrive, so should start to redesign\n - Mark: should only be moving the pin and maybe reducing the diameter. But then we need to machine it\n - Luise: can the tool be modified?\n - Mark: for one pin, you can\u2019t move it because of the close proximity of the pin that does not work\n - Luise: might also think about replacing the pins with something less rigid to press down on resistor\n - Mark: but they are not well hight controlled, so would not recommend this.\n - Mark: would also like to re-use as many parts as possible from the old tools to make it easier\n- Mark: also found some offsets in the R3 stencils\n- Please get in touch if you want to try new stencils\n### AOB",
