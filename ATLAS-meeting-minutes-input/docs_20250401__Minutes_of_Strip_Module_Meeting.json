On slide 5, you said you got these numbers from the DB, it would be useful to know where these iHybrids you expect to be. I don\u2019t know if those are the hybrids currently being interposed at CERN, or if they are stock at some sites. I thought there were less iHybrids actually.\n - Luise: These are not interposed, these are all the hybrids in europe that are either part interposed or not interposed. Currently in the DB it is impossible to know which ones are interposed or not because it is not in the DB correctly. It doesn't matter really, these are just hybrids that are in europe. If they are not interposed they need to go to CERN. \n - Carles: Fair enough. For IFIC sending PBs on slide 12, that can be done. We just need to know the numbers you need. You say 33/66% split on the R5s correct?\n - Abe: I guess in theory it should be something like this\n - Carles: On slide 6, you have that. So \u2154 at IFIC and \u2153 at DESYZ. If you can say how many to send, it can be arranged.\n - Abe: Okay thanks, I will have to check and let you know if we agree on what the numbers are.\n- Nghia: For Montreal, this plan is [absolute] to us. Do we have a timeline for this? Would this be one or two months, or longer?\n - Abe: I don\u2019t really have a feeling for how long the shipments take. As fast as they can be sent out please. \n - Nghia: Okay, we can have the shipments as soon as we can then.\n - Abe: these will all be needed to start any modules.\n- Carles: Do we know when the new round of PBs will be available?\n - Abe: I think someone from Freiburg should confirm\n - Dennis: I think in 1-2 weeks, I\u2019m not entirely sure. It depends on if we can get cold cycling working. \n - Carles: They are already in hand\n - Dennis: yes there are some already in hand \n - Carles: Can you remind me roughly how many you have?\n - Dennis: Somewhere between 5 and 10 per flavor.\n - Carles: 5 ten carries?\n - Dennis: One carrier per \u2026 thing [Marc in the background]\n - Carles: okay, this is the new ones\n - Dennis: interposed and non interposed are roughly the same numbers one carrier of each.\n - Carles: Thanks.\n- Sergio: If you go to slide 12, to understand, if this uninterposed PBs go to Freiburg for the IN petals, what numbers do we end up with assuming they are all made into modules. Are they on the table?\n - Abe: (Slide10) these are the number I got\n - Sergio: So there is a deficit of R3s, is that right?\n - Abe: that is what I got\n - Sergio: Is a little bit hard to follow \n- Carles: So in one or two weeks we will have the PBs in these tables, and what is next?\n - Luise: about 2.5 months.\n - Dennis: Yeah\nVerbal Presenter: Dennis\n- Dennis: Team is at CERN, one technician is doing the gluing, one more advanced who will do the QC. Then there will be a third person doing wirebonding, then Abhishek is overseeing this. He unfortunately couldn\u2019t be there. I showed the techs the gluing steps. I think this will work fairly well. There is still work to figure out the glue dispenser. We did a couple of hybrid panels (3 days) and the last day the tech was working mostly on their own. I showed them the steps, they will document this for themselves, and I think Abhishek will present something this Friday about the status.\n - Carles: Have they interposed any real panels\n - Dennis: They were real panels. We did a little of the dummy panels, but I was there so there was no real danger. They just need wirebonding and they will be sent out.\n - Carles: Alright, I guess this Friday we will learn about the timelines. \n### Group Update: DESYs\nPresenter: Supriya Sinha\n- Vitaliy: For slide 3, the glue calibration. Can I ask you to remind us on your procedure?\n - Supriya: for the glue calibrations we fix the mass of the glue we want to aim for and we change the pressure with time. We use a python script to calculate the pressure vs time for the target weight\n - Vitaliy: The way I think about this is that there is some variance between runs, but in terms of dispensed glue, what is the impact on the variation there? If it\u2019s small, you can choose to live with it rather than calibrating at every batch.\n - Supriya: I agree that is ideal but what we saw is for each glue we do a dummy, if the glue amount is not enough we change the speed to match the amount of glue we want. When we tried to change the line speed it was fluctuating so much we could not tell with the next glue dispenser we would get to the value we want.\n - Vitaliy: The other thing, just FYI, we do a pre-dispense than a calibration for the same mix depending on the dispensed volume.\n - Supriya: Yes with the pre-dispense we do several rounds, what we found is each round we got further away instead of closer\n - Vitaliy: That sounds strange, you correct the speed of the dispensing.\n - Ingo: there are two ways to calibrate this: change over time and the normalization to shift this up and down. We determine this from line speeds before doing a proper dispensing.\n - Vitaliy: What we do we explicitly shift the pressure for different times\n - Ingo: That\u2019s technically difficult because we have to manually enter these pressures. So instead we change the line speed which effectively does the same thing. It\u2019s effectively the same.\n- Vitaly: the other question I have is (page4) it sounded you want the glue dashes to be disconnected?\n - Supriya: From what I know, it would be ideal for them to be separate rather than having a constant glue all over.\n - Vitaliy: Why is that\n - Supriya: With a constant glue this increases the chance of cracking\n - Christian S: If those blobs merge, then you get higher curvature in those blobs which create higher points of stress. So we wanted patterns where they don\u2019t merge.\n - Vitaliy: separate dashes are similar to glue dots that increase the chance of cracking?\n - Luise: This is based on one of the simulations where long continuous layers are worse than short layers. So we went with that advice. As far as we are told, that increases stress.\n - Vitaliy: They are so small they resemble dots. The real question here is this going to be used with interposed or non-interposed?\n- Carles: For interposed flexes, the first batch you send to toronto these should be used if they look good enough, what are the timelines, we were looking to not have a gap between freiburg and hamburg flexes\n - Sergio: We discussed this at a previous TF meeting where William mentioned that the reduced number of hybrids isn\u2019t helpful. So we have interposed them and they will evaluate them, hopefully we can use them too. I don\u2019t think they will be able to put them into production until they get more of the arrays in the next few weeks. The plan is to use them though.\n - Carles: Are we okay to use them?\n - William: We have already done a few hybrids that Dennis interposed, my problem with the 24 is they only make a panel, we can't start those until we get the next 100 panels. There is 140 hybrids of all flavours interposed and on their way to montreal so in ~3 weeks they will be in Europe for making modules \n - Sergio: Expanding on this, I hope that these hybrids leave DESY this week. We expect to see ~100 arrays this week. As soon as we\u2019ve completed 30, we will send them. My expectation is we would be able to do 20 arrays per week, so in two weeks or so, I expect to send 30 arrays with higher yields to Canada. By 4 weeks, another 30\n - Carles: Regarding failing test frames, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve found a particular flavor causing issues. Are we planning to do any additional QC to determine if they are bad since this is more painful. We should probably track these problems as well.\n - Luise: when you receive the new test frames you are supposed to check the whole batch, you can't electrically test every channel, if you have bad test frames send them to Dennis so he can look into it. \n - Carles: Is there any flavor that is worse than others? Perhaps it\u2019s the manufacturer?\n - Luise: currently they are all still from Freigburg, we have only had about 8 bad panels so not enough to draw conclusions.\n- Luise: On slide 3, you said you have seen a strange batch and have now calibrated to this batch. I worry this is an outlier, are you planning to recalibrate in subsequent batches?\n - Supriya: We have to see if the current calibration works, if it doesn't we can try the old one if not we will have to start from scratch. \n - Serhat: We have tested the batch after this and it looks like it gives us stable glue masses over time. At least for this batch.\n - Luise: I think I am more worried you will get the next batch and it will be weird again.\n - Serhat: The one we just received yesterday looks good with the same calibration. In the end, we may have to try it out at least once to see if it behaves sensibly because it\u2019s hard to trust the consistency of the glue after seeing this.\n- Pavol: On slide 6, what is it about the cleaning that helps?\n - Supriya: with purified water we reduce the friction so we can insert them all the way in \n - Pavol: Ah, okay thank you\n- Pavol: About the crack in the brass fitting. We saw this and we also recommend checking the cracks.\n - Ingo: I remember you showed this and we were grateful that you had, it was a known risk.\n - A\n - A\n- Vitaliy: About the previous discussion about the possible bad glue batch. We have seen this before I think at other places. If other sites have seen uncalibratable glue batches, that would be worth mentioning since that could help other people.\n### Powerboard Coil Peaks on EndCap Modules\nPresenter: Luise Poley\n- Vitaliy: Interesting study. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s magnetic, I would have expected a stronger dependence on distance. For the irradiated module, was it tested in the same frame before and after irradiation?\n - Cole: Yes\n - Vitaliy: Okay, thanks.\n### QC Test Overview\nPresenter: Sven Sonsak\n- Ingo: For the finished hybrid, you have this hybrid summary test\n - Cole: This is something different, there are two summary tests that kind of do the same thing. There is a higher level summary which is this one\n - Sven: made by Sandia\n - Luise: this was supposed to collect all the information not just the electrical and give a overall summary of the hybrid, glue weights metrology ext\n - Luise: should be in the component visualisation GUI\n - Cole: it doesn't have good visualisation on it\n - Sven: should we remove the test or not?\n - Cole: no\n - William: we are not filling this for the hybrids done in toronto \n - Cole: the user does not do it\n - William: Someone needs to do this there is a lot of hybrids to catch up on\n- Vitaliy: do you have to remove it\n - Cole: This is about clarity. You can still perform an IV by removing bonds and bonding to the sensor, but if it has an AMAC, an AMAC IV is supposed to be done.\n - Vitaliy: [hard to hear, sorry]\n- Sven: we could \n- in the DB and cut it out in the sumarriesA\n- Luise: useful if you need to diagnose a different test, can just leave it if it doesn't get in the way\n - Cole: It's more to stop confusion from the standard QC chain\n- Sven: It shows up in a few stages that doesn't make sense. We should probably remove it from here. If you cannot do IVs with the AMAC at these stages then the module should move to the failed stage \n- JJ: For the IV, there are many IVs in TC. If any intermediate IVs fail, does it count as failed?\n - Cole: The merging will grab all the tests, but it doesn\u2019t evaluate them. \n- Marta: For slide 29, you have the metrology in the Endcap \u201cto be confirmed\u201d. What is waiting to be confirmed?\n - Sven: Not entirely sure guess interposed or not, this has a cut out on the specifications\n - Marta: So it\u2019s only for the glue heights?\n - Sven: I think so, cole there is no plan to change the positional criteria?\n - Luise: No plan to change, but we want to keep track of it and collect more data.\n - Marta: of course\n- Sandra: For the IV scan, I asked various folks about this because I\u2019m confused about the number we have to do. We do one after HV Tabbing. Do we have to do one before tabbing?\n - Cole: this should be if you have yields that show you have good IVs post tabbing\n - Luise: if the sensor L4 reporting shows the combined yield of initial test and post tabbing, then you don\u2019t have to do the IV until post tabbing.\n - Sandra: Is this all of history, including Pre Production?\n - Cole: if you have bad stats you should collect the data to show you have the process under control\n - Vitaliy: Sandra\u2019s question is interesting, perhaps we should have a running average. Things can change that may make you want to reconsider. \n - Cole: this is worth having, we already said in QC descoping if something weird starts happening you probably want to re-introduce the QC and compare the data\n - Sandra: So I do it for a while and see how it goes. Vitaliy was saying like a month?\n - Vitaliy: It\u2019s up to module ACs. \n - Cole: before going to much into it get the data\n - Bart: We are talking about the pre-tabbing IV, not post? Equipment can change, but you should see this in the tabbing. If the sensor QC works as intended, this shouldn\u2019t be a problem. We\u2019ll have to decide, but I had the impression that this was descoped\n - Sandra: That's what I am asking if we have to do it?\n - Bart: The HV tabs and sensors have been stable for a while\n - Ingo: we had this 1% 2% then its fine\n - Luise: To make this clear, Xavi has these reporting scripts that look at the post tabbing yields, if this matches the expected 98% yield, then this can be dropped. But it has to be shown first, then you can drop it.\n - Sandra: I was asking when I should apply for it. For the next period, or is it retroactive. When does it start?\n - Luise: can be retroactive\n - Sandra: So we have to run this script?\n - Luise: Or Christoph can run the scripts\n- Navid: For glue weights, has anyone ever had something fail on modules due to low or high glue that could have been seen in the glue measurement test?\n - Tony: We failed something with a low glue weight if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. We held it, it was a preseries module. The weight was about 8 units low (10%) and our glue heights are tending high at 140um. So high height and low weight. So we failed it (not in the DB yet, we need to look at it more). We saw it because we were weighing between hybrids and PBs. It\u2019s the only time we\u2019ve ever hit it. It is rare.\n - Navid: I just want to understand how we set the spec for glue weights. My concern is perhaps delamination or bonding.\n - Tony: The concern is the coverage is low.\n - Navid: Could affect the bonding\n - Ingo: And perhaps thermal conductance.\n - Tony: It only changes the chip temperature a little. It\u2019s not a huge impact. You have a low thermal contact that increases the ASIC temp. The interposer changes it by about a degree, so this is comparable. It could impact the bonding, but we haven\u2019t looked yet. We are worried about wasting a PB and bond it. You won\u2019t have any proof that the FE bonds or PB to Hybrid aren\u2019t ideal though save for deformation curves from the machine.\n - Ingo: This could cause thermal runaway\n - Tony: This won\u2019t be a problem\n - Tony: It\u2019s not a bad question, Navid, but when we did the original requirements, we decided that if it was low on coverage/weight, but the height is okay, then it\u2019s okay. So I don\u2019t know.\n - Luise: When we discussed this in the past, there was the question of dropping this since we can\u2019t pin a failure number. We might not be able to arrive at good limits soon, but people may want to monitor this to see if they are depositing the right amount of glue. The discussion never got resolved.\n- Luise: Sven, if you\u2019re updating the stages anyways, the interposed attached was intermediate. For now, I think it should be a normal stage, can you do that?\n - Sven: I have a discussion with Freiburg first, but then we can set this up.\n### Interposed Module Pull Tests\nPresenter: Len Morelos-Zaragoza\n- Ingo: Is this the SE4445 coverage?\n - Len: Yes\n- Tony: Is this good enough then?\n - Navid: It seems it is fine\n - Tony: We need to have agreed-upon sets with some spec so we know if it\u2019s okay. We probably have another 90 or so parts.\n - Navid: it would be good to not waste parts if we can use them.\n - Cole: I say if it\u2019s fine at 2mm, we go with this and if more stats cause issues, then we revisit this.\n - Vitaliy: Is showing a sketch\n - \n - Vitaliy: I think this makes the results make sense. If it was just the ASIC without support, this would be different. [inaudible]. This is conservative based on data so we are not going wild here, if people are having problems bonding they should check UV glue coverage. That should be done before accepting the new coverage\n - Cole: I think that\u2019s reasonable\n - Tony: We\u2019ll continue this until we have rebonding needs. You can\u2019t tell if the pulls are affected or not, but we\u2019ll use PQIC and let you know. \n - Sandra: I support what Vitaliy is saying, the people that are bonding in berkeley said the same thing that the UV glue is far more important. That really did help. The fact that we have less than 1mm this should not affect, this is what the expert bonders at Berkeley are saying, for before pre-seres we had bad coverage and it was okay. \n### Descoping Discussion: Barrel Pre-TC Module Bow\nDiscussion Leader: Navid\n- Tony: I\u2019ve seen Gerrit\u2019s measurements. The bow change is small. We had a stave where it was quite low as well. We did see a few above 100um, but the target is 150um. I don\u2019t see any data. For post cycling, it\u2019s not us, it\u2019s a question for the loading. We don\u2019t do post cycling bow on modules\n - Navid: For us, it\u2019s not very useful, but it might be worth monitoring for SS.\n - Tony: Post TC is a loading measurement.\n - Gerrit: The precycling bow, as a loading site, we aren\u2019t interested in it. The bow cycling [?] We will keep on doing. The preloading bow is not a lot of overhead at this point. In production it will be, but not for the preseries. It gives us an extra handle before and after loading, we will keep doing that as long as we can.\n - Navid: Sounds good, so I think we can descope the precycling.\n - Vitaliy: You mean as a module reception site?\n - Navid: Yes, for loading.\n- Carles: No objections. Since we can\u2019t correlate pre vs post bow, it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep doing it. For cycling, there is a barrel-only loading meeting to discuss this. \n### AOB\n- Nope",
