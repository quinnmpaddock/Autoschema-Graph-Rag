Cold test with a mockup was done (8 HV tabs on half moon with even harsher CTE mismatch and found all tabs survived\n- Much discussion\u2026 result: \n - might be good to add wriggle to HV tab when installing on core. Method to do so open\n - Will be good to see results for more realistic setups (bond to sensor backplane on one side and core on other or core-2-core as worst case then thermal cycle\n### Suction cups\n- Agreement that nitrile was not the way to go\n- Some worry in the US about the manufacturing quality of the suction cups\n - Not seen in the UK supply\n- Worries about AS material left on sensor (either residue or from imperfections in manufacture)\n- Equally well, AS is the \u201ccorrect\u201d way to go\n - Need to confirm whether it causes any noise issues\n- Regarding experience with AS suction cups \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it...\u201d?\n- To be revisited next week...\n### EC hybrid panel transport frame\n- Drop cover at back of hybrid transport \u201cbox\u201d?\n - Should be ok, Marc will check with Kambiz\n - If Kambiz is ok with shipping without back-cover we will drop it\n - Marc will report back to Karo if this can be dropped from the list of required purchases\n- Marc will also ask Kambiz if frames/panels are final so that we can start EDMS review\n### AOB\n- asd",
