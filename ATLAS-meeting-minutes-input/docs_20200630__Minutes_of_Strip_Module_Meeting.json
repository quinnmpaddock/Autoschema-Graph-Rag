Should happen tomorrow \u2192 Marc will forward what he learns wrt to timeline after that discussion\n- More pressing issue right now is to get panel PCB designs done, panel jigs will follow after that \n### Dowel pin tolerances (Masahiro)\n- US can\u2019t achieve tolerances for the holes in a way that prevents dowel pins from getting stuck eventually\n- Sven mentions that this concern was raised too late since the UK has already started producing tools so we can\u2019t change anything anymore\n- Most decisions made years and months ago, why was it not brought up then?\n- US apologizes for that oversight but wants to make clear that we need to find a solution in order to allow successful tool production in the US\n- Prototyping in the US has shown that holes got larger over time until they exceeded specs \u2192 claim that steel pins in combination with the aluminium jig and tolerances not doable in order to keep tools within specs\n- Steel instead of aluminium?\n - Too expensive, if one group changes to steel all would have to and we don\u2019t have the budget for this\n- Changing hole size? Would cause additional at least 3 months delay, we don\u2019t have time for that in our schedule\n- Is increasing the tolerance on the hole size an option? \n - Could work, compared to other position tolerances it wouldn\u2019t affect much\n- Changing tolerances would be preferred solution compared to changing design\n- Conclusion:\n - Tool being manufactured now should be done with updated tolerances:\n - In barrel that means D8 holes as suggested in meeting\n - In EC that means whatever tolerance required to get similar slipping clearances as suggested today for D8 in the barrel\n - In meantime, investigations to be done into bushing-based tooling\n - Any changes will need to conclude on timescale of 6 months\n - Note that this would allow barrel to incorporate changes into production tooling\n - EC plan for tooling being ordered now to be production tooling anyway\n### \n### Sensor IV (Bart & Vitaliy)\n- Is 550V ok as a reception test for bare sensors at module building sites?\n - Vitaliy would prefer to stick to 700V \n - Not a problem to do that even on module frame\n - Ingo is very concerned that people might then forget that for a full module they shouldn\u2019t go above 550V\n - Could software prevent this by having different limits hardcoded?\n - If it\u2019s anywhere outside of a module box Ingo is not concerned with applying 700V but inside a module box he is afraid it can cause to mix ups and introduce the risk to break modules by powering them too high\n - Concern about filter capacities getting stressed to the point where they break\n- What do we gain from testing again at 700V? \n- If we change the BOM and put 1kV capacitor in instead of smaller capacitor, we should be fine\n- Frame was designed for 550V, not 700V\n- No conclusion on reception IV to 550 or 700, to be discussed again...\n### Waffle tools (Scott)\n- Moved to next meeting\n### Bond pulling (Bonding QC group)\n- Moved to next meeting",
