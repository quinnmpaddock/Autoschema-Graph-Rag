Change barrel PB Bill of Materials (BOM)?\n1. Schedule to populate current barrel PB flexes\n1. Longer term: change barrel PB flexes?\n1. Schedule for that\n- Use of capacitors on stilts: in general, they are difficult to solder by hand, as the legs are soldered onto the capacitors and also melt. Using reflow seems best. \n- Send some to Penn to try out soldering there\n- Plan for first 2000 powerboards:\n - After discussion: populate all 2000 as initially planned, but leave the shieldbox off of 150 boards.\n - We also discussed though: [Jaya John is not sure if these 2 ideas are abandoned?]\n - Let\u2019s find out if we can assemble, at Epic, ~100 boards with alternative capacitors\n - Will require to replace all capacitors of the same type\n - Keep some unpopulated in case of further changes we want to try?\n- No clear replacement for the reverse-geometry capacitors\n- Plan to evaluate PBs with capacitors on stilts:\n - Make some PBs with capacitors on stilts\n - Get to SCIPP to build onto some SS modules, to test for cold noise\n- \n- As info: the PB contract is structured as 2000 + 12000. \n - This contract for 14000 is already signed. The only option so far is to have a gap after the first 2000.\n - The contract assumes no changes to the design after the first 2000. \n - Lead time for flexes: 7 working weeks + 1 week shipping + 1 week QC.\n### Flex questions\n- 3.0a don\u2019t see cold noise\n - This had through-vias on all 4 layers.\n - Reverse-geometry capacitor is rotated compared to all the other versions. \n - It has much less copper than later versions.\n - There are potential glue differences as well, being tracked down. RAL transitioned from using Polaris in Bi-packs to Polaris from bottles at some point, which probably increases the crystallisation of the glue. \n- 3.0b and c do see cold noise\n- 3.1 seems to have even more cold noise\n- Capacitor choices: might be worth calling Murata and asking for help\n- Via discussion:\n - Staggered vias don\u2019t seem to be the solution for cold noise (Dennis and Peter)\n- EC powerboards have cover layer and solder mask at bottom (for stiffness)\n - Discussed trying a small batch with cover layer and solder mask added, or stiffeners\n- We will make comparative laser vibrometer measurements of endcap powerboards.\n- Do we want to make a small barrel PB batch at W\u00fcrth as a comparison? \n - Sounds feasible. \n - Do we want to change the feed-through capacitor in parallel?\n- Three paths to pursue:\n - Add stiffener to powerboard\n - Make barrel powerboard from Wuerth\n - Try change of feed through capacitor\u000b\n- Measure the stiffness of barrel PBs and endcap PBs.\n - Send some endcap PBs to Timon for this.\u000b\n- Penn has offered Godwin\u2019s help in making modifications to powerboards.\u000b\n- For interest: a possibly relevant paper: \u201cEffect of ultrasonic strain on p-type silicon wafers\u201d https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.7567/JJAP.53.07KC07",
