New coupon-less proposal might be too much of a change\n- Ingo: smaller coupons might be a way out if funding really becomes an issue, but need to make sure everything is consistent with EC\n - Ashley: will add via chains on tabs to help if there are issues\n- Forest: only one coupon out of 3 that survives, need to test via chains on tabs; but can\u2019t reflow hybrids as many times as hybrids\n - Ashley: the batch test of 10 cycles on one coupon should be sufficient to qualify a panel, but need to be checked\n- Andy: does it change the amount of hybrids that are marked as failed when a single coupon fails?\n - Becomes only an issue if two coupons per panel are crossed-out circuits, but need to discuss with manufacturer (and part of procurement document)\n- Bart: cost penalty for priming order\n - Craig: only an issue if hybrids fail in PRR, otherwise no issue\n - Tony: might consider to change drop rate\n - Ashley: can be an issue with QC, so need to look at it; main issue is pull tests\n - Craig: if pull-test becomes an issue, it\u2019s likely that this will be dropped after pre-production to help (if evidence is good enough to support this)\n - Ashley: need also look how this is affected by SMD population\n- Forest: the option to have coupons interleaved in hybrid panel has benefits and is not much of an change; we should add these extra QC pieces in\n - Craig: but then have to change the automated system and also need to make sure this does not affect cost\n - Ashley: testing these structures is some significant work to do\n- Craig: no disagreement to change to one coupon per array and EC has same proposal\n - Dennis: happy with this change; but thinks change to small coupons might be a lot of work to implement (even the via chains on hybrid tab)\n - Craig/Ashley: also not too sure how much change is allowed in the procurement process / hybrid tendering\n- Question for Tony: process to get this through review process\n - Tony: need to flesh this more out: what are the effects of crossed-out coupons; what changes for LBL; number of vias; how to justify not doing test coupon tests after SMD (reflow at SMD is not more aggressive than the one done for QC; but could consider to leave one coupon on panel instead of doing 5 reflow for QC)\n - \n### Star DAQboards - updated!\n- Soo cool: new member in the PCB adapter family - PCIe - module data adapter board\n - PCIe MDA \n- Are the PB connections very different\n - yes\n- Should institutes donate their spare SLVS boards?\n - Absolutely, that\u2019s why we kept asking to fill out the survey\n - Will be discussed in Production Planning meeting on Thursday\n### Dummy powerboards for the endcap\n- Jonas: like to get part of orders for 3D printed powerboards, but haven\u2019t looked into doing this ourselves\n - Luise: have heard from several sites looking into making them, but so far not heard any news\n- Step files for powerboards are available on EDMS with correct shapes and SMD components\n- Carles: they are not cheap, but it would be worth it; will look into how to pay for this\n- Luise: would be good if everyone discuss in their institutes and discuss it on Thursday (similar to procurement of glass sensors)\n### AOB\n- None",
