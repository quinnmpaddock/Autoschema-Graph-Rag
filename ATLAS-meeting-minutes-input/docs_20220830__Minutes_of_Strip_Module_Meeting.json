Do groups now want to try the new stencils?\n - Luise: R5 already a request\n - Ingo: will try to mimic pattern with dispenser\n - Uli: would be interested if there are plenty stencils available\n - Luise: they haven\u2019t been made so far, but if there is interest we can talk about producing them\n - Luise: have made R5 and R4\n - Peter: didn\u2019t make R3, but can talk about this (and R1)\n - Luise: will send an email to ask for stencil wishes\n- Sven: what is the thickness of the stencils?\n - Peter: 250um\n- Luise: request: if you find missing/corrupted data in the database, please let us or the respective site know so this can be looked at.\n### Slow control tests for hybrids\n- HCC & ABCstar LDO enables\n- release of HCC reset\n- Hybrid NTC read-back\n- ABCStar Shunt Control\n- Calibrate input\n- SSSH to AMAC\n- Add: check ABC reset\n- Ashley: just came up with a slow control test list, some things we are not doing right now\u000bOnly if those test pass a full test should be done\u000bIf they fail, should fail a hybrid\n- Vitaliy: are all these signals available on hybrid panel?\n - Ashley: one of the reasons of using the powerboard is that all these signals are available and routed to the hybrid\n - Vitaliy: then implementation is just software?\n - Ashley: yes\n - Luise: all functions are already there, just need to come to a conclusion on what we want and then it can be implemented as a nice ITSDAQ macro\n- Ingo: where did you foresee to run this? At the burn-in crate?\n - Ashley: could be a test that is done prior to loading the panel into the crate\n - Ingo: not sure if we decided that single hybrid panel test is mandatory\n - Ashley: is not mandatory, but can done in the hybrid crate as well\n - Ingo: it wouldn\u2019t take long?\n - Ashley: no, is should not\n - Dennis: should also run on a module test to check wire-bonds\n - Ashley: should be done\n - Luise: run this test first before ramping HV?\n - Dennis: can do this test at HV\n - Ashley: SSSH might cause an issue with HV?\n - Dennis: it only resets the state machine \n - Dennis: the only command resetting the AMAC is OF\n - Paul: that is what the design is\n- Tony: if we do this without calibrated AMAC, will the results be reasonable?\n - Dennis: currently don\u2019t have calibrated AMACs, hopefully later, currently only testing that communication works\n - Tony: any test on AMAC is useful (even uncalibrated) and then do calibrated test on a module\u000bNeed two different tests with slightly different requirements\n - Ingo: would you try to read HV or would you just try to read HV\n - Tony: would read 0\n - Ingo: if you read 0, that would be OK. Only an issue if you read something else\n - Tony: doing this test earlier could feed into the json files later\n - Dennis: for e.g. cold box tests, could use FMC-DP\n- Luise: Is there anything that needs to be tested for EC?\n - Dennis: for design validation need to make sure that the LDO enable ends up at the correct place (only once for design validation)\n - Tony: are there repeater functions to be checked?\n - Dennis: yes, that is checked\n- Luise: who has to write the software?\n - Dennis: I guess Bruce\n - Luise: so we need a list of test and then get the tests setup\n - Dennis: defining the results can be a bit tricky (LDO enable check which ASICs are enabled)\n - Tony: do you want to check the bPol output? And low power mode?\n - Dennis: already part of powerboard testing and checked there\n - Ashley: if you know the hybrid flavour you should be able to get an estimate for the current draw\n - Dennis: yes, for the hybrid test that would be true.\n - Dennis: ABC reset is missing\n - Ashley: was deliberately left since this is not from the powerboard\n - Added now to the list\n - Dennis: for design validation need some more expert look-up, but only once\n- Luise: all hybrid types have been built now, so could organize to ship one hybrid panel of each type to Freiburg for Dennis to do the design validation\n- Sven: should have this in the database as well\n - Dennis: ideally just have a binary list of tests that were passed\n - Sven: probably up to Bruce\n - Dennis: e.g. a boolean for each of these",
