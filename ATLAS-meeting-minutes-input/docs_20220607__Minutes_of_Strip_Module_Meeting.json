Andy: What are we looking for? Luise: what do we gain from filling in the test. See: \n1- Are people filling in correctly? Are they not filling in the test and then discovering problems in the electrical testing?\n2- Uploaded correctly with no problems many times? Then, if there are not problems (at least usually) is this test useful?\n3- people filling in with no problems but then 1)?\n- HV tabs:\n - Forest: Is the review before parts? Do we receive parts before the review? Luise: Review only before the testing but only for the EC\n - Tony: statement about everything done before ppb2. Do we need to process the thermocycling the data? Luise: only having the data to do the analysis.\n - HV tabs: need to be checked because the sheets will have different laser parameters in different areas\n- Conversation about the cold noise. Gerrit: if not in a coldbox, since the cold noise appears before the freezing temp. Any setup that can cold modules down to a reasonable temp can be used to study the problem. Bart: Almost comissioning the setups in the UK. Luise: the point communicated: people really need to set up the coldboxes soon.\n### Task tracker items\nUpdates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda\nAnd also task tracker for updates\n\tUpdate from Ankush\n- Luise: possible to merge data files of coldbox and burnin:\n - Ankush: yes, keeping that in mind, going to present the plan at the burn-in meeting\n- Sergio: how\u2019s the representation of the end-cap in these coldbox meetings?\n - Ankush: generally lower than barrel, but key people are joining the meetings (Priyanka and Hannah)\n - Priyanka\u2019s work should benefit everyone, but people using different hardware may need additional support\n - Ankush: tried to make it as easy as possible to run on all different setups\n- 14/06/2022: Barrel\n- 21/06/2022: EC\n### Institute Contributions\n- Argotech\n - Slide 4. You are out of specs in some cases. I recommend practising more before you continue building to gain repeatability. \n - R2 PB glued to the transpor frame. Normal? Luise: NO! Maybe related to the outlier.\n - Andy: what do you use to apply the glue on the stencil? Pavol: plastic card. Andy: not using hamamatsu plastics anymore, use stiffer material\n - Vitaliy: waiting a given time of curing before applying the glue? Pavol: Yes.\n - Vitaliy: how flat is the PB? \n - Vitaliy: gap under PB?: Pavol: metrology soon.\n - Luise: how long do you wait after mixing? Pavol: 10 minutes. Luise: recommended to wait at least 20 minutes, wait longer to get the glue thicker\n - Carles: did anyone else see glue squeeze out under the R2 powerboard? Vancouver: no. Carles: did you set the pins on the powerboard pickup tool correctly? Pavol: yes\n- SCIPP\n - Postponed\t\n### End-cap module test update\n- Meeting tomorrow 4PM CERN time\n - https://indico.cern.ch/event/1166985/\n- John Keller: Difference in strips lengths playing a role? Luise: they do, but not justifying that difference.\n- Sergio: Is there any obvious difference from R3 wrt the others? Luise: Asked the question but no response yet. \n- Gerrit: hand assembled with spacers, did you check the gap? Peter doesn\u2019t have the metrology. Very difficult to measure the R3 PB. Luise: spacers of at least 120um under PB.\n### Strip Database Reporting\n- Luise: would it be possible to also use information about whether a test failed to distinguish between good or bad components instead of just stages?\n - Conor: can probably be added\n - Luise: need to think about how to do this without adding 15 if-statements\n### True Blue experience in the UK\n- Sergio:\n - Wondering if the shear strength of the glue is affected by giving it more pre-curing time\n - Should test that\n - Luise: yes, should ask to make lap joints under same conditions\n- Luise:\n - Do we have other experiences suggesting different pre-cure times\n - No\n- Tony: how much working time do we have after the 75 minute pre-mixing?\n - Matt: can play with that\n - Ingo: would assume it\u2019s better than Polaris\n - Andy: documentation says 1 hour\n- Bart: tried to put Polaris and Epolite on slides and poked it with a stick and found that True Blue needs more pre-curing, but then cures more quickly than Polaris, true Blue sets much quicker afterwards\n- Could look into freezing True Blue\n - Matt: haven\u2019t thought about it, can look into it\n- Sergio: how did you store the glue?\n - Matt: packaging says room temp\n- We have a recommendation for how to use True Blue: 75 minute pre-wait \n- Ingo: before recommending a four-hour wait time, we might want to check x-y alignment as a function of time\n### Testbeam update: resynchronisation\n- Andy: is this a problem that only occurs in testbeam or is this a module problem that only shows up in testbeam?\n - Jens: only seeing it in end-cap modules\n - Andy: is this only because we\u2019re running fast?\n - Jens: we\u2019re not even running very fast\n- Jens: worried because we see this in the R5, but only one HCC\n - Andy: both streams?\n - Jens: yes\n- \n### IV test comparison (postponed to next week)\n### AOB\n-",
