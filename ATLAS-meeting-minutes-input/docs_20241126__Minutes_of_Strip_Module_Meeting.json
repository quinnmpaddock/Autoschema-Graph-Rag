But then it could be higher. It\u2019s not like a touch probe, so it\u2019ll often find one that is higher than the ones you actually touch, which is why we use an average.\n - Ewan: Ral updated our thing, so we don\u2019t just do that.\n - William: I\u2019m aware we have to get the equivalent of several points. But we\u2019ve been seeing it exceed 5.87.\n - Luise: Can folks make sure to update their local scripts? Some might use the webapp. Whatever you use to calculate this, please ensure it is updated.\n- Bart: We don\u2019t maintain our own code for this, we rely on the webapp. What\u2019s the timeline for the update to the webapp please?\n - Kenny: If I get new code, then a week. \n - Bart: Okay. \n - Kenny: Someone will need to hold my hand with the analysis code.\n - Bart: We rely on this heavily, so it needs to be updated for us.\n - Kenny: Everything is relatively up-to-date.\n - Craig: Isn\u2019t this just changing one number?\n - Kenny: Should be, but if the analysis code changes, that might be more work.\n - Luise: My point is that the update should be checked that it works\n - Bart: Do we not upload data in the meantime?\n - Luise: Override the failure if the only thing that is wrong is that it\u2019s over the old limit (but below the new limit). That\u2019s all that needs doing in the meantime\n- Hand Acknowledgement \n - (i)PRESERIES_* goes for parts after rFDR up til rPRR\n - 15-ish hands, but they keep falling because folks needed to clarify the text living on the page.\n- William (sl. 7): After the PM meeting yesterday, this is one of the few places where we use Kenny\u2019s scripts to upload the IV. Is there somewhere inside that script to set the flag?\n - Luise: The problem here is that it\u2019s not the sensor that passes IV and that passes the flag. You have to have done a VI as well. So it can\u2019t set the flag for you at the moment. We are looking to make a script to get these done in large numbers, but don\u2019t expect it to be automatic at the moment.\n - William: [repeats Luise that we want it automated]\n- Tony: General rFDR question. The US is on Thanksgiving holiday. A lot of our inputs will be finalized tomorrow. We\u2019ve been working hard with Ewan and I know what Bart\u2019s talk is for the other presentations. No one contacted us.\n - Luise: The other things we needed were the yield estimates. Anne is sorting out the QA results. Then Cole with Electrical results.\n - Tony: it will be difficult to follow up on after today\n### L4 Updates\n#### Module Production\nPresenter: Abe\n- William: Thank you for the diagram. The next thing will be \u201cwho makes what\u201d.\n - Luise: Separate diagrams. This is the first step.\n- Carles: The cluster ones should be up-to-date.\n### QCD Corner: Episode 9\nPresenter: Cole Helling\n- Ingo: this was required by the reviewers in the FDR, we even thought back then that this was pointless back then, but they insisted. We will need to tread carefully and see how the reviewers react\n - Cole: Did the reviewers request 100 hours at 40 degrees specifically?\n - Ingo: we came up with the numbers, but why \u2026\n - Craig: during PDR, we said that this was basically what we could do, because we didn\u2019t want to go higher because of the glue, it went slightly different during the FDR, because the reviewers asked if we really learn anything by doing it like that, since the SCT also descoped this eventually, because they never found anything\n - Cole: we never really caught anything that couldn\u2019t be caught by a normal electrical test\n - William: we can just tell the reviewers that we have done this for 1000 hybrids and have never found anything and we never fail anything like that, and it has real life implications, because e.g. 10% of panels are currently sidelined in Montreal\n - Craig: And they fail?\n - William: it\u2019s the requirement of 10% failure rates failing hybrids\n - Cole: It's a lot of transient errors, failing coolings, etc, but it doesn\u2019t seem to catch ASICs failing due to infant mortality etc, which is what this is meant to catch right?\n - William: yes, we always look and never found anything\n - Cole: we should at least check with the reviewers\n- Cole: This discussion is to understand what we want to do: do we want to stop using this entirely? Because it is a bit useful to test ITSDAQ for extended periods of time\n - Stefania: In the end, we need to deliver a working detector, and currently, the benefit of testing this does not outweigh the delays and the effort that goes into this - Peter had an idea for what to do?\n - Peter: don\u2019t remember\n - Bart: mention here 100 ihybrids data - we should have that data by the time we reach iSS\n - Cole: would be good to look at the data\n - Bart: if we want to use this as an ITSDAQ test setup, we should not burden the hybrid sites with it\n - Cole: proposal would not be to have this done by all hybrid sites, but to leave them in places that want to use ITSDAQ. The test is not useless, it\u2019s just testing ITSDAQ rather than hybrids\n- Ash: getting nervous because after one year of stalled production, we will now restart hybrid production and we would like to at least maintain burn in until we have the first production batches tested\n - Cole: we will not descope today, and you can always test in the future\n - Ash: stopping this now is premature, we should wait until we have tested the first hybrids\n- Peter: not all ASICs are created equally: some are from high or low yield wafers, some are from slow or fast wafers, and descoping this now means we may descope before we have data from all corners of the wafer production phase space\n - Cole: sounds like it could still be useful, although not for the original purpose\n - Gerrit: Are we discussing to completely drop hybrids or just limiting how much we test them? Because they are on panels already and we want to test them, the problem is just how long we need to test for. We should still test everything for the reasons discussed earlier. I am against dropping testing completely\n - Cole: yes, this is the discussion: we seem to want to continue testing, but we seem to agree that 100 hours are not well motivated\n - Gerrit: one hour could be enough\n- Cole: sounds like \n - we do not want to drop the test entirely\n - We want to reduce the time\n - We want to keep more testing in special places, maybe\n- William: where are all the different corners of the process?\n - Peter: prototyping was done with things in the high yield corner, but there were low yield lots later and it would be good to test these as well\n - Peter: need to figure out which lot is which\n - Paul: it\u2019s a database exercise to find out which ASICs have been used for what, which have been used on hybrids already and where these are\n- Cole: we also need to check with the reviewers\n - We may rediscuss to have some sites not do this at all in the future later, but sounds like most people think we want to continue burn-in in some capacity\n### Group Update: QMUL and CAM\nPresenter: Paul Miyagawa\n- Sven: The batch stuff should be solved by the end of this week. A new release in the DB software will allow folks to remove/add parts to batches regardless of who owns it.\n - Paul: Thanks \n- Luise: It\u2019s useful to know what people are struggling with and we are trying not to break things.\n- Luise: While you\u2019re showing the [mic problems]\n- Vitaliy: What\u2019s the vertical axis? Is that um or mm?\n - Bart: Sorry, it\u2019s millimeters\n- Vitaliy: You had a really huge bow for some of them\n - Bart: 100s of um yes. Some had 200 um bows and that was a preamble to cracking\n - Vitaliy: The middle area of the plot on slide 5. That\u2019s the danger zone?\n - Bart: For interposed modules it\u2019s higher. Permanent bow then gets baked into the module\n - Vitaliy: And the blue are interposed?\n - Bart: Dots are non-interposed. The blue bands are the easter holidays where we didn\u2019t cycle. The dashed lines are for the interposer modules\n - Vitaliy: Interesting that the difference is so large. Thank you.\n - Bart: D\n- Luise: You said that the interposers show less bow change than non interposed, but it looks like they reach roughly similar levels, just later?\n - Bart: The deformation is for less temperature. The iModules need higher temperatures to see the same bow development\n- Tony: What are the temps there?\n - Bart: the setup can\u2019t go lower than -44, so that is the cold limit, on the high side, it is 56 on the high side, which gave us a nice difference of 100 degrees\n - Vitaliy: Because there is a difference for interposing, that the bow is created by True Blue. The UV glue has to be at higher temps for the iModules, so that doesn\u2019t matter. \n - Bart: Yes, that is a fair statement. We all know what causes the bow. You can interpret this as the stresses at high temperatures being so high that even SE4445 can\u2019t decouple it anymore. Interposers don\u2019t remove the symptoms, they just mitigate them.\n### QT Update: Module Test Data Reporting\nPresenter: Katie Walkingshaw Pass\nWilliam: So this can be done for data that has already been uploaded to the database?\n- Katie: yeah that's correct they are in the repo locally but eventually will be in the web app\nCole: wasn\u2019t this meant to work for EndCap modules as well?\n- Katie: I will continue to work on this, I am in the process of making it available for EndCap sites\n- Cole: it would be greatly appreciated if this could be made to also work for the other six module types\n- Ewan: what did you use to see if this is compatible with different browsers\n - Katie: These are python scripts using Altair. It produces the plots into any browser window. Currently using Safari.\n- Bruce: Is it easier to integrate things into the web app and then do the extensions\n - Luise: I thought this was the plan as part of the component visualization GUI.\n - Bruce: yes this is switching the two bullet points around, slide 9 \n - Luise: I think that would be good.\n - Bruce: The summary webapp needs updating, and I think this would be good to update it. I think extending to different module types shouldn\u2019t be too difficult.\n### 11 Features of Module Metrology Data They Don\u2019t Want You to Know About\nPresenter: Ewan Hill\n- Bart: On slide 6. Still we are still in R&D, we do dry-run the PBs. It\u2019s the biggest source of modules not making the cut or getting glue squeezed out or whatnot later on. We did re-shim and did a dry run, which I think explains the spread. It\u2019s us fiddling with shims.\n - Ewan: Okay, it seems as in shims are a big cause of failures at the moment\n- Tony: on the next slide (slide 7): you are correct about the negative values, point 5 is indeed on the tab, which tends to bend, so just ignore that. Point 2 has less material and can be thinner, so that makes sense, but -50 looks very wrong and is out of spec. Point 1 is really worrying. Would be great if we could get a table of the worrying ones to check. The problem is that we usually only see averages and they don\u2019t show up there, so we would need a list of the individual points.\n - Ewan: So for reference, I uploaded all my plots to CERNBox. So you should be able to find the individual measurements in those plots so they can be checked out. I recognize PB5 being crazy is expected.\n - Tony: Two being slightly negative isn't crazy, those are impossible it looks like you might be subtracting incorrectly. I makes everything look bad if we have negative full PB measurements \n - Ewan: Okay, offline we can investigate the PB1s a little more.\n- Theo: if you are getting negative values, it could be the sensor plane, e.g. if you measure on glue and it affects the sensor plane calculation\n - Tony: if you look at the data it looks like just a couple of parts standing out. THen we can make statements about things going wrong. We have been looking at hybrid issues and it would be good to get that explanation for that. If we don't sort it we will have to start another task force to look into the low yield. \n- Tony: It\u2019s the same thing about making a list. It could be wide-gap, but those shouldn\u2019t be in these plots. In the barrel, it should definitely be true. Not sure about the EC. For the presentation, do you include parts that are interposed and not, both and separate. How would you do that?\n - Ewan: All the ones I looked at are interposed object\n - Tony: I don't know why there is interposed wide gap interposed parts\n - Luise: They are in the EC. They are all being built wide-gap for R4/5.\n - Tony: we need to subtract the number or come up with a different target for them\n - Luise: Once we have the final plots from Ewan, we can explain away a few of these things\n - Ewan: sent around an email where we asked for clarification on all the weird modules, please respond and we can sort this out\n- Karol: Is there a reason for barrel to not just focus on array interposed objects \n - Tony: There is not a lot. No reason to exclude them. Especially because they are PBs.\n - Karol: For hybrids, your first stave was hand interposed?\n - Tony: everything in here is hand interposed, there are only six non hand interposed hybrids on modules in the US right now\n - Karol: I meant hybrids, not all parts. Okay, I forgot you did a lot by hand.\n - Bart: there is edge based metrology with interposers where the object is where it should be but the interposer isn't and the metrology machine is picking that up \n - Tony: It doesn't drive 400um. \n - Bart: it could\n - Tony: It shouldn\u2019t\n - Bart: if they are the early ones, it could be, or if it is a glue splurge\n - Tony: We should dig into this and find out if that is the case.\n - Bart: thats a lot of work for one or two entries\n - Tony: its not one or two entries \n - Luise:\n - Ewan: The backup slides have a failure matrix showing the type of failure with the serial number. So we can see that in the barrel the majority of failures are from PB package height, and the rest are mostly X/Y deviations.\n - Tony: If there's enough patterns we won't really know what they are if we dont follow up and it turns out to have a low yield of 50 to 70%\n - Ewan: I\u2019ll double check if those serial numbers are known and follow-up offline.\n - Tony: email chain has been mostly hybrids which has ended up being a few causes, if we do this for hybrids and modules and we show we are okay. If we don't have a time variant to show we are fixing this as we go along why would they believe us\n - Luise: Ewan, is there a chance to compare the array vs single interposed parts? If we got you a list of two populations, would that work?\n - Ewan: its possible my inputs for these plots is a list of serial numbers so I can just put a list in\n - Luise: Would it be possible to get this list from the UK?\n - Tony: the interposed list of hybrids exists. Ewan has it. Chasing it to the modules I\u2019m not sure.\n - Bart: Kenny\u2019s [?] scripts do provide that information\n - Karol: i have my own monitoring scripts that can do this\n - Luise: That would be great, can you send this?\n - Ewan: please do send unfortunately my slides are not complete so sorry for being a week late.\n- Tony: we\u2019re doing the wrong thing locally (averaging instead of highest point) and we found that it is a tilt, not a height issue, because one end is higher. Not always, \n - Luise: in the interest of time, it\u2019s okay. We don\u2019t need to worry about this too much.\n - Tony: if it's tilted you may not have it glued down flat\n - Luise: let's look into it and understand what's going on eventually but lets pick our battles\n- Tony: I think people are tired of me talking. The package heights of the first BHM ones we don\u2019t understand. When the package height is correct and there are no shim issues, this is totally okay. Having this time-ordered with extra data is useful, so hopefully we get more data put in. I know BHM has more, and it should all be passing. RAL too, shows the fix and better control of the package heights.\n - Ewan: okay I will add those extra hybrids on \n - Tony: You\u2019ve been doing an amazing amount of work. I don\u2019t know if there are any extra US parts, but I don\u2019t think there is. \n- William: On the hybrid slide (15), since we first saw these with the EC plots. They looked like this at the PRR stage. It has to get better than this if you want to respect these values. The RMS is not what we hoped for as a \\pm 40um. When we got into production, we really started to fail parts. I second Tony\u2019s concerns that adding interposers is going to make these targets harder to hit. \n- Craig: Thanks Ewan Tony and everyone this is a huge amount of work, As we went through the slides we discussed areas where we have to drill into the data, given the time of the review we have to be a bit realistic, Ewan, how far do you think we can drill down onto all of these points. Given the time scale maybe this is the data we have and we need to create the story around it. With the barrel shield box heights the yield is not a good one but given where we are it is a yield we can build a story around. My question is how much more can we drill down or do we bite the bullet and write the story based on what we have now?\n - Ewan: I think we can\u2019t cover everything before next week. Going back to the failure matrices to target certain things allows us to focus on what is more useful. The X/Y deviations are something that if we can quantify, it would potentially boost the yields. \n- Tony: PLot on slide 21, THe X and Y we shouldn't chase because we know what the problem is, we really need to dig into the glue weights and the PBs, it's the stuff that can cause the most problems. Hybrid XY and PB glue weight.\n - Craig: And is this true for the EC? [Craig recognizes it is mainly barrel people talk about]\n - Ewan: For the EC, the failure matrix is quite even everywhere.\n - Tony; The PB XY you can make the same argument, it's the glue weights, the explanation might just be the hand interposing \n - Ewan: With a lot of what I\u2019ve presented. People have confirmed they are problems, it\u2019s just a matter if we want to quantify/qualify it and explain that we don\u2019t yet know the yields.\n- Craig: At this stage I wouldn't be adverse to say this is the failure matrix right now. There has been a lot of change to procedure while we have been doing this. We should make it clear that it is unfair for the reviews to judge on these plots with the expectation that this is pre-production. We need to get more into a production state to look into these. This needs to somehow become something we track all the time at the site level. We do these big data collection and the and drill down and what we should be doing is doing it at the site level\n - Luise: Maybe it helps to say what message we are planning. There are a few known items that will improve. Especially in the EC, the early interposers done by hand are something we can explain. We can say that we do see an improvement from pre-production as sites gain more experience. Depending on the EC decision soon, we need to convey that adding interposers for the EC does reduce yields. Which means we really don\u2019t want to go with interposers in the EC if we don\u2019t need to (not easy in the EC is the message).\n - Craig: sounds good\n- Vitaliy: A part of the messaging will be that there is a learning experience with interposers, which is only fair. The yields with interposers for EC is low, but that might improve. The metrology is somewhat more pronounced, and a bit more obvious we have some things to improve on.\n### Chasing Cold Noise with Taped Module\nPresenter: Yoshi\n- Cole: when it comes to noises 25 lower that is within the noise threshold, you might have to look at your temperature to make sure that's not the reason, \n- Luise: this only works if the tape peels up and hits the hybrid. This would require that the tape peels off the sensor but sticks to the hybrid. Is this what is happening?\n - Yoshi: The tape stuck to the hybrid instead of the sensor, but Vitaliy should comment.\n - Vitaly: We can check for it Luise, its next on the list, the tape is stick but it is peelable from the half moon\n - Luise: Thank you.\n- Vitaly: I thought we agreed t\n- Navid: yes, there is no interposer meeting. I\u2019ll send out an email to say it\u2019s cancelled.\n### AOB\n- Nah",
