Visual inspection to look for burrs.\n- Finding hole centre is more reliable, so will measure relative distances (if hard, still need to measure). Center of holes where the hybrid/sensor positioning pins can\u2019t be checked by placing the pickup tool, need to try to measure their position by vision means of the vision machine.\n- Upload to DB will be sorted\n### Hybrids and modules in the database\n- No comments\n### AOB\n- None",
