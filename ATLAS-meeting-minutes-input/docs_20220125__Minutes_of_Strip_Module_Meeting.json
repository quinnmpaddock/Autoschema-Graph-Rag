Done\n- SMD tendering for EC pre-production/production hybrids\nTender ongoing, as soon as we have a bidder we want, paperwork can be submitted, then CERN order can be placed\n### Hybrid testing database implementation\n- Andy: scripts that use the database interaction, do they live on database or ITSDAQ repo?\n - Christian: will be on the database repo\n - Andy: no plan for ITSDAQ GUI to call these?\n - Christian: no\n- William: get_components.py requires that components are already assembled in database?\n - Get components is only checking all the parts and children\n - Script then uses components and fuseIDs to map the child component to component under test\n - William: it assumes that hybrids are already assembled in the database with the correct children?\n - Bruce: yes, will expect database assembly to be correct;\n - Need a check to see if FuseIDs match components in the database\n - Andy: if there a preference what fuseID is correct? Order of hierarchy?\n - Bruce: look up which hybrid by HCC, then check the ABC fuseIDs\n - If wrong, disassemble them and assemble the correct part\n - Craig: it\u2019s kind of tricky and will probably require some manual intervention since ITSDAQ can\u2019t know the flex ID without user input\n - ASICs are mapped, but hybrid flex is the difficult bit\n - Luise: if you have 10 wrong ASICs, than it might be you have the wrong hybrid\n - Vitaliy: maybe another script to look in the database for the wrong fuse ID to find out what is wrong (and why)\n - Luise: this is part of the hybrid assembly qualification task\n - Christian: is it checked during assembly?\n - Luise: no, it needs electrical tests first and from that a file to compare against the database assembly\n - Vitaliy: would be good to have something that helps the operator in case something is wrong\n- Luise: most likely will not work for prototype parts because ASICs are not in database?\n - Christian: yes\n- Luise: is there a way to upload tests even if there are no information about the ASICs?\n - Christian: need the hybrid assembly serial number to upload something (and need institute location code)\n- Luise: do you keep the name PPA or will you change it?\n - Christian: currently to distinguish the PPA test from the currently implemented test in the database\n - Luise: it is possible to use the PPA version throughout production?\n - Christian: yes, could also delete old tests\n- Luise: on what timescale is it going to be implemented?\n - Bruce: waiting for me to do some work\n - Christian: also some json output needs more work\n - Luise: 2 weeks, 1 week?\n - Silence\n - Bruce: try to do it in one week\n - Luise: do you need anything from groups to help with it? Test data?\n - Bruce: yes, PPA root files would be useful\n - William: OK, could provide them (but not time walk)\n - Craig: full test doesn\u2019t currently include timewalk\n- Luise: mentioned that there would be error messages if something goes wrong. How would they look like?\n - Christian: they will tell what error happened (e.g. wrong stage, wrong institute, \u2026)\u000bMessages printed in terminal and also into a log file\u000bSometimes also get warnings (e.g. wrong database key that will be ignored)\n- Andy: is this going to be scaled up to module loading?\n - Christian: guess so, but only looked at PPA hybrids\n - Luise: there is a dedicated discussion for module testing later; loading sites are just doing module tests so should follow same scheme\n- Luise: are you going to update the testing procedure dokument?\n - Christian: the google dokument?\n - Luise: yes, update google dokument and then do another EDMS review\n- JJ: upload.py script is compatible with current json files?\n - Bruce: ITSDAQ will need fixing. Could re-analyse old root files to get correct format\n- William: what when testing at different locations?\n - Christian: for upload should work, could also get the list for components from multiple institutes\n- \n- \n### Discussion of DB questions for single module testing\n- Luise: is testing a module the same as testing a hybrid? Can the module testing procedure document refer to the hybrid dokument for that?\n - Vitaly: don\u2019t think hybrid and module are similar. Module test should also include bias voltage and might also include more information about the powerboards\u000bTest structure should be different\n- Luise: should there be an additional test for the environmental information?\n - Bruce: should be header information in result\n- Luise: for module, is the bad channel definition similar to hybrids (are cut\u2019s similar)\n - Discussed in meeting on Thursday\n - Vitaly: parameters should be different between hybrid and module\n - Bruce: X and Y hybrids on a module will have same cuts, but probably not for EC \n - Craig: hybrid level, cuts should be the same\n - Dennis: yes, but not on modules due to different variable\n- Luise: then there would be different tests for hybrids and modules in the database\n - Vitaliy: yes\n - Bruce: will have to check on exactly what to do; tests are mostly the same just need some extra information\n - Luise: need to follow up once we have agreed on hybrid testing\n### Endcap coldbox control PCB\n- Dennis: how many spare crimp contacts can you supply?\n - Alexander: yes, will supply some\n - Dennis: make it at least 100 each\n- How much power do you need to power the peltier elements\n - Roughly 15V and 6A (to be checked)\n - Geoffrey: polarity switch is rated higher\n - UK/China (?) using 10 bench power supplies (single channel)\n - Alexander: design of box between barrel and EC is different so not necessarily compatible\n - Sergio: 8W of dissipated power is not enough for heating\n- Need to check this to make sure they work!\n- Alexander: do we want to discuss humidity sensor mounting here?\n - Sergio: probably better to discuss it offline\u000bBut, humidity sensors need to be inside sensor air volume to get a good reading, e.g. using a T adapter\n - Dennis: wouldn\u2019t it be better to flow air over the sensor?\n - Sergio: sensor does not fit in tube\n - Dennis: you have to connect the T to the sensor as well\n - Sergio: there is an inlet and outlet for the air going to the sensor\n - Dennis: why can\u2019t the sensor be on the exhaust? Are you concerned about the nitrogen?\n - William: had the same concerns\n - Sergio: you assume that the air is warmed up from the module. We are injecting cold air into the system\n - Dennis: you don\u2019t want the warm air inside of the box\n - Sergio: dry air that is injected into box is cooled down, if you use exhaust, you are inserting warm air\n - Dennis: worry with T is the stagnant air that needs time to get to the same humidity value\n - Alexander: wouldn\u2019t it be turbulent?\n - Dennis: no, festo is designed not to be turbulent\n - Sergio: alternative would be a housing inside the ESD foam, but this would have to be done for every single module and the foam would have to be re-worked\n### First module gain correlations\n- Luise: what would be the best way to present own data? Send it to you or should sites to it themselves?\n - Vitaliy: can set something up to collect the information\n- Luise: are there instructions on how the read out the hybrid NTC?\n - Vitaly: I don\u2019t have any. Bruce would probably know.\n - Dennis: 2000 numbers are from ABCs\n - William: 3 digit numbers are from HCC\n - Dennis: for hybrid NTC there is a calibration, I can read out the values\n - Luise: how?\n - Dennis: use one of the AMAC functions, but not sure which is the official one\n - Dennis: calibration is not properly done yet, therefore no official instructions\n - Luise: would be good to invite ITSDAQ experts to explain how to do this\n### AOB\n-",
