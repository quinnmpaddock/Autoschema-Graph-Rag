Have just very coarse review to look for obvious mistakes but not looking into every small detail or raise any technical discussions again\n- Discussion: Don\u2019t want to wait for one tool set to get reviewed and then start review of others, should do all of them in parallel\u000b\n- R4 \n - awaiting feedback, then quick EDMS. then place order, then 25 days for tender process, at the end of that get prototypes, then start full order. Then 8 weeks (6 weeks mill, 2 weeks annodise, 2 weeks assemble = 10 weeks)\n- R5 \n - 2d drawings in prep, should be finished tomorrow, then quick EDMS, company has material and is waiting for go-ahead. Then prod depends on parallel work at company, expect about 4 weeks\n- US powerboard prod\n - Hit little snag, missed one design change\n- Small parts of tools / screws etc?\n - Will add task (Karo will send email to Craig for good task segmentation)\n - Screws are about to be ordered\n - Pins/bushings are getting offers\n - LED bars are in Fr hands\n- Common order parts?\n - We need also tasks here and Karo is on top of things. Karo will also send an email for a good task\n- EC module test frame finalisation\n - No Freiburg, hope that Kambiz can soom give ok for EDMS review round. Some SMDs might not be available in required quantities so might have to change to equiv\n- EC hybrid panels\n - Should be final, EDMS review can begin\n- Barrel hybrid panels\n - are final, parts have been received (EDSM did not keep up\u2026 we should do an empty EDMS round so it is signed off\n - Frames should go into US production after EDMS review\n- Barrel module testframe\n - Same state as hybrid panels, pile available in Liv\n### Discussion of options regarding the tendered hybrids (Dupont vs. Thinflex)\n- Thickness changes DP vs TF?\n - There is no change, from end user point of view no change\n- It is just the internal core, the adhesive remains the same\n- Thinflex was tested, is core material for EOS, will be in detector, so as qualified as DP\n- Grafics (spelling) thinks TF is 1-to-1 drop in for DP\n- Problem orig started Dec2019, expected to recover March20, did not yet and DP notified Europe wide that delays will continue, new production line expected in Mid 2021\n- Ash would go to TF\n- Bustapes went from DP to Thai-Flex (?) and that material is qualified in the bus tape world\n - Will check what Grafics wants (and propose Thaiflex as alternative)\n- Will go to TF and keep DP open as fallback in case of issues observed\n### Storage in moisture barrier bags max time\n- Propose to \n - have to put items into dry storage after say 5 days after shipment arrived\n - Short visual inspection to ensure moisture bags arrived intact, nothing obvious is broken\n - then have time for proper reception for 30 days after shipment arrived\n - 5 day limit should be valid for all items\n- If storage was to break, keeping items in dry bags could be an emergency storage method\n- Discussion on how to deal with update of storage doc\n### Bonding wedge longevity\n- Looks like significant change after 35000 bonds, will that cause problems?\n - No this is just Hesse setting the quality of the wedge to a lower level after 35k bonds. No actual change, just a fixed parameter change to notify the user\n- Tools inexpensive and changing doesn\u2019t take too long, change more frequently?\n- Discussion, some folks want to pull test after each module. We can let them do it if they manage prod rates, but will certainly not make it a requirement\n### Effects of thermal cycling on ITk strip modules\n- Some of the excess metrology results could derive from different light conditions and metrology systems\n### AOB\n- none",
