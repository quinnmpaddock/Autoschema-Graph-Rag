It\u2019s mainly for going forward\n- Theo: If we want to make a module batch, do we need a hybrid/powerboard batch?\n - Luise: you can have the module in one batch and the hybrid in a different batch. The database does not care\n - Theo: can hybrids be batch-less and I just make a module batch?\n - Luise: yes\nSlide 5\n- Theo: document stated 1V/s, which is slow\n - Luise: difference is that if you want to measure the IV, you need to ramp slower and have a settle time\n - Luise: if you only want to ramp, it can be done faster\n- Tony: are we rolling this out now for PPB2 modules? We are currently doing the ramping manually which would be impossible\n - Luise: how are you doing the raming now?\n - Tony: by hand with the front-screen of the Caen\n - Luise: if you can ramp with 10V/10s manually, can you ramp it faster?\n - Tony: yes, but you would need someone physically sit there to do the raming all the time, but right now we have things automated\n - Peter: working on ITSDAQ implementation for the automated raming\n - Tony: so we can\u2019t roll this change out until the remote/automated power supply control is available\n - Peter: can look at the cycles\nSlide 8\n- Tony: we don\u2019t have the actual thing for the thermal cycling test, what do we do?\n - Luise: you can just upload a single test\nSlide 9\n- Theo: have been doing testing in barrel with cold box and think we have seen this as well\n - Ashley: I have tested a hybrid panel today and didn\u2019t see any errors today\n - Ashley: I have doing it from the command line and didn\u2019t see any issues\n - Ashley: will try update ITSDAQ and try it again\n - Peter: look at the HCC phase settings (offline), that is the likely issue\n - Bruce: don\u2019t run the phase scan, this could also cause the issue.\n - Peter: if you run the phase scan, you need to re-flush the firmware\n - Ashley: would it be the same with a 3PT gain from command line\n- Andy: Is it written down what the difference between physics mode and counter mode is?\n - Bruce: not as such, but counter mode uses the counters in the ASICs, while physics mode is what we actually want to use\n### Institute Contributions: \nNBI\n- \u2014- cancelled today\nNext meeting: Argotech\n### Monthly pull test discussion\nSlide 14\n- Luise: do you think we should standardize what we do in case of issues? Is there a judgment call what to do?\n - Forest: it can be, e.g. if most wires fail in a certain region. It\u2019s hard to know what happens if there are no comments that are added to the data\n - Luise: so if the test fails, people should try to get the parameters changed to improve the data\n - Forest: don\u2019t necessarily want to recommend changing parameters all the time, but want to ensure that when assembling something from a batch the batch should be tested first and if it fails need to look into it (without changing bond parameters)\n - Forest: could happen that after change fo parameters, you are suddenly overbonding\n - Luise: maybe as recommendation to clean and try at a different location, but also comment on what is see.\n - Forrest: worth it to also upload failed results and comment on that\n- William: when you differentiate between source and destination, it\u2019s both on a hybrid?\n - Forest: yes\n - Forest: looking at the tendency of the failure mode, we\u2019re still comfortably available from our lowest pull strength level (even at 3 sigma), but when you have a source break, that goes close to the allowed minimum sigma, so it\u2019s an indicator to maybe do further investigation\n - William: what do you think is the difference between source break to destination break (or source peel to destination peel)?\n - Forest: at a very small level, the bonding process is different. Source only have a small wire tail, while at destination have a large wire on both ends\n - William: but empirically, the numbers are pretty much the same within uncertainties\n - Forest: we are doing pretty good. Tried to separate directions to pay attention to (slide 6)\n- William: looking forward to what happens for sensor to sensor or ASIC to ASIC bonds, which seem to be more reliable\n- Kirsten: (about re-testing) one of the options is cleaning and then re-testing on hybrid flex. If we are talking about production batches of hybrids and flexes, unless you have a very good suspicion that the flex was not treated correctly, I don\u2019t think cleaning it and re-testing should be the first go-to option because this would imply that all production parts need to be cleaned.\n - Luise: would use it as diagnostic tool to see that there is actual contamination\n - Kirsten: agree, but it should be further down the list of things to try\n - Forest: 1st go do a different location on same sample; if fails 2nd go to a different flex from same batch; only then might want to check cleanliness\n - Luise: shouldn\u2019t be too strict here, sites should use good judgement\n - Kirsten: also should compare with other sites that use the same batch to filter out local issues\n - Forest: can we have a human readable batch number in the google document?\n- William: if you wander into a bad place on the coupon, it could be that the hybrids are bad. Need to be very careful\n - Forest: yes. In industry would just pull a piece out of the batch and test it. If it fails, do some more tests, but if pass then it should be good (e.g. from a one-off failure)\n - Luise: this is an evolving process\n### Cold breakdown in module cycling and stave testing\nSlide \n- Andy: are we looking for something that could cause breakdown or things that cause breakdown?\n - Theo: right now just look at everything\n - Luise: need to build up information\n - Andy: do we also track the opposite (e.g. glue on guard ring that does not cause breakdown)\n - Andy: and are there any other things apart from breakdown that are quantified (e.g. number of cycles)?\n - Theo: we track number of cycles and in spreadsheet also can comment on the symptoms of breakdown.\n### Batch reporting\n- Luise: the UK will soon need to be able to update batch information for modules that were registered in one batch but were then moved to a different batch - could you add a function that allows to update batch information, please?\n - Kenny: yes, have something in mind already\n- Luise: there are few talks on how features work, do you have a collection about this anywhere?\n - Kenny: will try to collect this in itkdocs\n### End-cap module metrology update\n- No specific questions\n### AOB",
