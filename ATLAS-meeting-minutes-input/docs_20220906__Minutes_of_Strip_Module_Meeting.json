It this works, we can potentially change to that\n- Tony: cold noise meeting on Thursday, if you have any slides please sento to Tony\n - Ashley: has sent some slides, but I\u2019m not available for the meeting\n### Task tracker items\nUpdates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda\nAnd also task tracker for updates\n- 06/09/2022: Barrel\n- 13/08/2022: EC\n- 20/09/2022: EC\n- 27/09/2022: Barrel\n- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)\n - Still waiting for response from CERN about harmonised export codes for petals\n- Powerboard testing setup roll-out\n - Dennis focused on getting powerboard designs ready\n- Single Hybrid Testing Database Implementation\n - No news\n- Hybrid Burn In Software\n - Ilona: script to check for panel type so that parts which needed user intervention are now automated\n- Multi Module Test\n - Notes on indico\n- Modules for Test Beam\n - Next testbeam at the end of November, need to wait for powerboards\n- Powerboard bending studies\n - No news\n- Glue Studies\n - Halfmoons were irradiated and sent back to TRIUMF for more testing\n### Institute Contributions\n- \nNext week: \n### Experience from PPB1 end-cap hybrid assembly\n- Dennis: short in R1 panel, most likely the connector (solder between feet)\n - Luise: is there any QC done on the panels before they are shipped?\n - Dennis: no\n - Luise: can there something be done?\n - Dennis: this type of short is easy to spot, others are harder\n- Forest: concern on the wire bonding side: have you tried cleaning pads to see if the peel rate improves?\n - JJ: not quite sure, will have to ask\n - Forest: is Celestica making the hybrids? Or are they just doing the assembly?\n - JJ: just the assembly\n - Forest: up until now, we cleaned all barrel hybrids\n - Luise: we are in discussion with Freiburg about cleaning all hybrids before they be shipped\n - Forest: going to 50% deformation to meet the specification need to check that the bond feet are not damaged\n - JJ: also would be good to compare\n - Tony: what about the pull tests on the coupons?\n - Zeuthen did some pull tests on coupons\n - Ingo: if force is OK and you don\u2019t have any lift-offs, Forest why are you concerned about heel cracking?\n - Forest: there are a lot of degrees of cracking and 50% of deformation is quite a bit\n - Ingo: you might not catch the edge cases in the pull tests. \n - Forest: pull tests are also in ideal conditions, not like on a real object\n- Vitaliy: believe the heel becomes a weak point when oversqueezing, CMS had this problem and found it can cause problems. Would be good to see how much the bond foot is squashed (compared to specification)\n - JJ: hope the next batch of hybrids will be better\n - Ingo: best way forward is cleaning\n - Luise: want to avoid that everyone has to clean in house\n- Luise (slide 11): we need to agree on wether we want to use hybrids with one or two bad ASICs. Considering the hybrid shortage, we probably have to need those\n - Ingo: would support this. If ASICs break during production, then we need to stop this, but this looks more like a config issue\n - Luise: also one panel of each type is send to Freiburg for tests, so they could look at config issues\n - JJ: how can I make sure its a readout issue?\n - Dennis: you know for sure if they work. Usually ASICs either work or fail, there should not be a subtle failure\n - Luise: did you send this errors to the ITSDAQ expert list?\n - JJ: yes\n - Luise: if you followed all their advice, its more worrying. Then would send them to Freiburg for expert help. It would be good to also send the config files when doing this.\n- Luise: don\u2019t know what to do about the R5 situation\n - Dennis: most likely a config issue or bonding\n - JJ: should we use the hybrid or just wait?\n - Dennis: if you can, you should wait until I can do some tests. The new panel should not be worse than the old version\n - Luise: can you look at R5 panel before the last is assembled?\n - Dennis: yes, if this works for Toronto\n - Luise: in production we would probably throw out a panel that is not working, but not sure what to do now\n - Ingo: can panels be tested on a tape testing robot?\n - Dennis: not really\n - Ingo: PCBs are tested by manufacturer?\n - Dennis: yes, so it is most likely something about the soldering\n - Luise: can we do a test with a powerboard to check for a short?\n - Dennis: only for power, but not for other features\n - Luise: if we have instructions on how to do a panel test, we can do it.\n - JJ: should we move one or two of the problematic hybrids to a different panel?\n - Dennis: should not make a difference. Would prefer to have a look at them in Freiburg first.\n### Testbeam summary (DESY, August/September)\n- Andy: do you have any idea about the MultiIO board\n - Jiri: we used previous generation of FE-I4 in June, where we had some issues (buffer size, dead pixel)\n - John: online monitor worked in most scans we did\n - Andy: good to see!\n - John: we did look into this in old runs, if the buffer filled it desynched, and then recovered after 6 \n - Andy: did you see the cold noise in any other module before?\n - Jiri: no\n - John: we also have never done such a detailed ramp\n - Vitaliy: were the chips on these modules irradiated?\n - John: no\n - Dennis: were they on R1?\n - Jiri: Yes, they were pre-irradiated\n - Andy: and this is an irradiated sensor?\n - Jiri, yes all sensors were irradiated\n### AOB\n-",
