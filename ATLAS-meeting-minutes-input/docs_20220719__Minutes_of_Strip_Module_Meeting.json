And the loading sites will get most modules to start the loading\n- Carles: I\u2019m worried about the delays if they need to be changed\n - Luise: we try to make the current tools working. It might be necessary to remove one pin making it slightly less stable, but should still work and we would not be without tools\nDennis talk:\n- Ashley: where are you going to power the linPol from (which side of the inductor)?\n - Dennis: at the moment: from the bPol side, will move it to the petal side\n- Andy: is the pPol12 to change for production?\n - Dennis: currently using V4 and planning to use V6 in production, but have experience with using V6 and they are not too different\n - Dennis: so don\u2019t expect to have to make changes for V6\n - Peter: would you also look at Ashley\u2019s suggestion (not changing inductance but look at traces on powerboard)\n - Dennis: looked into this and shorted both sensors and still made it worse\n - Dennis: will look into suggestion anyway\n### Task tracker items\nUpdates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda\nAnd also task tracker for updates\n- 19/07/2022: EC\n- 26/07/2022: Barrel\n- 02/08/2022: EC\n- 09/08/2022: Barrel\n- Endcap module thermal cycling setup\n - Rest of cold boxes is being distributed\n- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation\n - No news\n- Production of frames\n - Waiting for tests of new frames (expected in two weeks)\n- Production of stencils\n - Jiri: frames were distributed\n - Ingo: Problem with R3 stencils?\n - Marc: should fix it\n- Glue Studies\n - Making progress with \u201cglue on sensor\u201d tests, continuing with irradiation next\n - Dortmund: continuing work on mechanical samples\n### Institute Contributions\n- Liverpool\n- Luise: can the automated visual inspection be used for the end-cap as well? \n - Sven: Should technically be possible, needs to be adjusted for end-cap hybrid geometry\n- Luise: could use Ian Dycke\u2019s code to assemble ASICs to hybrids?\n - Sven: yes, wasn\u2019t possible this time because ASICs weren\u2019t in the database\nNext week: SFU, LU\n### Barrel Bond Documentation EDMS Review Comments\n- Reopen review for module bonding document\n- Slide 5: is the statement on slide 5 okay or should more be added?\n - Forest: can we just specify that shorter bonds shouldn\u2019t be higher than longer bonds?\n - Sven: will add it to the slides\n- Ingo: do we need to update the hybrid bonding document (slide 6 comment?)\n - Sven: this is defined in the bonding documents and outside the scope of this document\n - Forest: could we add links to the bonding documents?\n - Sven: yes\n - Need to update the hybrid bonding procedure document, Sven and Luise to prepare for next week\n- Slide 7: Craig: can maybe remove it, since it doesn\u2019t matter?\n - Sven: matters sometimes\n- Slide 8: top comment:\n - Forest: since it\u2019s a tiny pad and we need this space for module bonding, let\u2019s remove it\n - Craig: since it\u2019s really important on a module, agree\n - Sven: so we\u2019re okay with not testing this trace?\n - Craig: unlikely that this is the only trace that fails, so happy with not bonding this one\n - Ash: trace is tested by manufacturer, so can just remove it\n - Everyone agrees to remove the bond\n - Will be changed\n### Barrel Powerboard Flatness Measurements\n- Gerrit: thanks for the summary! For the time being, will measure all the powerboard shapes, slide 7: not using powerboard which is bent by 120 um, so it would end up on a module because the shape wouldn\u2019t be noticed and glue would go all over the place\n - Kirsten: possibly, will build with this powerboard and see what the resulting module looks like\n - Gerrit: mentioned that glue gap is acceptable, which sounds strange because we should have 120 microns +/- 40 microns, but we are seeing different heights, what are we going to do?\n - Luise: part of the descoping exercise: check whether modules which are out of spec have good performance\n - Gerrit: do we do the same thing for hybrids?\n - Craig: didn\u2019t we do that already?\n - Sven: need to wait for proper tools\n- Craig: slide (X) showing results for PB-12: does the shape measured after metrology match the metrology of the powerboard backside?\n - Gerrit: that\u2019s why we measure from the backside: because measurements on the front are not reliable\n - Kirsten: yes, they do seem to match up\n - Craig: metrology seems to indicate that the powerboard in the stave area does not provide good bond support\n - Gerrit: same as what\u2019s being seen in stave bonding: very springy bond areas, need to bond as closely inwards as possible\n - Kirsten: glue is pulled back from sensor edge as much as possible to avoid glue on guard ring\n- Luise: the question about relaxing the glue height requirements, this is something that could be looked at (descoping)\n - Gerrit: will wait until new tool is uses with larger HCC vacuum hole\n - Gerrit: if hybrids bend down too much towards the sensor, can\u2019t glue down powerboards anymore, so it\u2019s a tradeoff\n- Bart: exactly where the metrology is deviating most from nominal is where we see the cold noise. We should wait with relaxing the specifications until we know more about the cold noise issue.\n### Powerboards after irradiation\n- Luise: have you reported this back to the DCDC people\n - Dennis: not yet\n - Luise: could you do this please and keep us in the loop?\n - Dennis: yes\n- Luise: Timon mentioned it could be user error. Any ideas if that could be the case?\n - Dennis: for SS there was a power cut, but nothing like that for R0 so this is unlikely\n- Luise: there is a plan to do another irradiation towards the end of this year\n - Dennis: will see what we can do for that\n - Jiri: slot not booked, need to know which one we should request\n - Dennis: as late as possible\n - Jiri: and which dose?\n - Dennis: same (it is never sure which exact dose we get, but usually more than we ask for)\n - Dennis: we should get close to the dose we target\n - Jiri: 2 weeks for irradiation, we could ask for the last two weeks this year\n - Luise: good\n- Peter: do we have any idea how hot in temperature the coil was?\n - Dennis: since hybrid temperature was -15, it was probably not outside the normal operation window\n- Peter: should we irradiate coils without shield boxes by themselves\n - Dennis: had coils irradiate before but did not find any issues\n - Peter: were they powered when they were tested?\n - Dennis: no, and not sure if powering during irradiation would make a difference\n - Peter: should try to do it in an earlier slot to get this information earlier\n - Dennis: if it is insulation that goes bad, Cobalt irradiation should be fine\n- Vitaliy: do you think it\u2019s a high current in the DCDC-converter?\n - Dennis: could be actual force: 2 A going through coil, there is a force due to magnetic field, could have something to do with it\n - Vitaliy: it is not the coil itself but rather the connection to the powerboard?\n - Dennis: yes, need to find a way to irradiate a powered coil\n - Peter: and possible not the DC field either\n - Dennis: if we have an easy way to irradiate powered coils, need to loo into it\n- Luise: there was also the issue with transients in bPol causing higher currents. Could this be an issue\n - Dennis: slide 6 power drop of module was as expected. One guess from Peter was that the LDo\u2019s fail, but if they fail in a short state we should see this. And we know that the bPol is not stable and will fail with low inductance\n - Dennis: measured two inductors on charred coils, inductance is down, need to investigate more\n- Dennis: might still be something else than the coil, need to wait until we can cut the boxes open\n### AOB\n- https://edms.cern.ch/document/2750436\u000bBarrel Module Bond map open again for review, until end of this week",
