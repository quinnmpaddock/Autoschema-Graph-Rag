Yes, if they can do without water spots. Need further discussion with vendor.\n - Barrel has opted for no-clean process because this is now industry standard\n - 3 weeks for sending them out\n- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)\n - Tasktracker updated by Carles\n - No triangle shipping, need to check impact for all countries \n - All shipments might need to go through CERN\n - So far all countries checked (China, Canada, Spain) answered question about \u201cwhat counts as modification\u201d with a statement that assembling hybrids/modules would fall under modification of material and therefore prevent temporary import/export schemes (currently getting double checked in Canada)\n - Need to get this checked for every country involved\n- Barrel hybrid tendering/order\n - Discussion between Ashley and Graphic about copper thickness of inner layers\n - Need to wait for QA of thinflex circuits with thinner copper process.\n - A few weeks until decision can be made\n - Gerrit: would this affect the mechanical stability?\n - Graphic thinks the thinner copper will result in better circuit\n - Availability of raw material is the critical part for PPB hybrid production, not specification\n - (delivery issues with Dupont)\n- EC hybrids/powerboard tendering\n - Weekly meetings to discuss progress\n- Endcap module thermal cycling setup\n - First EDMS review still open\n - Couple of missing drawings and couple of clarifications required\n - Sergio: close review, update drawings and open again (either to accept it or for short review)\n - DESY workshops \n - Outsource machining\n - All DESY workshops had been temporarily closed; back open, but large backlog -> try to push boxes priority\n - Have to finish few manufacturing drawings (very soon)\n - New update in 1 month\n - Gerrit: need electrical brakes in plumbing to jigs but need to be careful that they don\u2019t leak at low temperature\n - Not sure if needed because full box is floating\n - Grounding in peltier-based boxes is different than for non-peltier boxes\n - Want to isolate chiller from box\n - Endcap cold-box design allows for breaks outside of box if required\n - William: do modules need to fulfill noise specs in cold box\n - Craig: yes, so far all tests show that it is possible; need to see after first tests how the noise behaves\n- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation\n - Re-ordered R2 arrived today\n - R3 testing in progress, looks mostly OK\n - Karola: Dortmund need to spend money soon, so would be good to get feedback when they can order the parts\n- Production of bonding and testing jigs (EC)\n - Waiting for design of test jigs from Sergio -> less than 2 weeks probably\n- Production of R0 and R1 test frames\n - Update in 2 weeks\n- Production of R2 test frames\n - Update in 2 weeks\n- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames\n - Update in 2 weeks\n- Production of hybrid panel cover\n - Order additional pieces because of threaded inserts?\n - Some holes are close to edges, which increases risk when push-fitting inserts\n - Gerrit: tested lots of inserts and all pushed parts damaged the polycarbonate. Only heat-fitted inserts worked reliably.\n - Should try test pieces with different hole sizes to find best match\n - Timeline for final delivery?\n - First parts need to be ready in 6-8 weeks\n - Full set has more time\n- Production of stencils (EC)\n - Liv not in meeting\n- Production of LED bars for the EC\n - Issue with LED PCBs not fitting in jigs\n - Working on design update and Re-ordered\n- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order\n - Flexes in hand, go to SMD population\n - Next update in 2 weeks\n### Long-Term Humidity Study (Vitaliy)\n- Assumption that modules will be in dry storage, but not during assembly\n - Stave assembly done in 2 days without dry storage, but can be longer if issues arise (up to approximately a week)\n - Might have to look into how to mitigate longer exposure during assembly\n- William: Is there a plan to do tests with keeping modules dry (e.g. to check for other impacts on modules)\t\n - Preproduction sensors have been kept dry for a long time\n - Some experience across community with modules from prototype phase\n - More concern about modules than for sensors about dry storage impac\n - This test particularly to look for sensors, not modules\n### EC ASIC Misalignment (Luise/Sergey)\n- Fiducials are not aligned to sensor position (or sensor position is not aligned to fiducials)\n- ASIC centres are aligned to centre of landing pad\n - Kambiz will provide dimensions of fiducials with respect to landing pad centre\n### AOB\n- None",
