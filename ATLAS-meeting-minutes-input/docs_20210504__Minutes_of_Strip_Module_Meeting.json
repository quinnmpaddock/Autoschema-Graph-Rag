American freqs can\u2019t be used in Europe and the other way round because of spectra usage (mobile, military..)\n### A common test for IV curves\n- Header information: scripts in database to extract all components at current institute into text file and use this as look-up file\n- There is no requirement to immediately upload files directly after the test\n - Bruce: need to support upload at a later point (even though database access should be available at all times);\n - Might be more problematic if there are restrictions on the work environment (e.g. from cleanroom)\n - Vitaliy: QC code is not just for uploading, but also for data inspection and other features\n- Sensor envelope has also the printed serial number below the barcode\n- Vitaliy: SCIPP is not using LabVIEW;\n- Gerrit: item 1 is hard to realize to get all groups using a limited number of measurement software\n- Luise: different output format for sensor IV and module IV. can this be implemented in already existing measurement software?\n - Vitaliy: yes, SCIPP system can be adapted\n - Luise: would be good if sensor QC sites could keep using their software for IV measurements by just modifying the output format\n- Vitaliy: groups need to ensure that all groups adhere to certain measurement routines and safety procedures\n- Vitaliy asks Bart: how to UK tests sensors after HV-tabbing\n - Bart: using Prague code, which includes shut voltage; use same setup for all measurements (HV-tabbed sensors and bare sensors)\n - Shunt voltage field is already in database for sensor IV test\n - Would be good to keep in case it is used by some groups\n- Christoph: would be good to define a new test type for IV after HV-tabbing\n - Bart: should be as close to sensor IV as possible to compare results of module IV with sensor IV\n- Question: does IV of sensor with HV tab belongs to sensor or to module?\n - Add information in file header as comment\n - Gerrit: better to have a flag or a new test type\n - This is not only relevant for test after HV tab, but also when items are shipped\n- Luise: would be good to propose a file header design in next 2 weeks and discuss it\n- Need also ensure to make sure extraction algorithms work for all possible IV measurement output files\n - Extraction of derived parameters is happening during database upload (for sensor QC)\n - Luise: would be good to test this to make sure e.g. current is not too noisy for algorithm to find breakdown voltage\n- Need a more complete list of systems people are planning on using\n- Need to check that current systems are compatible with IV file analysis \n### Waffle Wedges for Tab Bonding\n- Asked community to notify with wedges are used for tab bonding\n - Mainly waffle tools used\n- Tab will break at 480g (tensile strength)\n- Propose to require using a waffle tool for tab bonding in documentation\n- Recommendation: should to all tab bonding in one session to minimize tool changing\n - Keeping in mind that there are QC tests required before bonding a tab\n### AOB\n- None, out of time",
