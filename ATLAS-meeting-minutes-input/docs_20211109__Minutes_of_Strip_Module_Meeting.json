Follow up with Craig\n\tValencia: started to use stencils to test gluing process - suspect shims were not used correctly, plan to start building more dummy modules to start setting up wirebonding programme\n\tQuestion about testing: Ingo will send hybrids on a test panel, does that work for Valencia\n\tValencia was expecting to test on a module frame\n\tTo be figured out offline how parts are sent and tested\n\t\n### PPB Deliveries Discussion (EC)\nSummary (when, where, how many)\n- ASICs \n - ABCStarV1\n - Pre-irradiated before end of January\n - Should have \u201cplenty\u201d of ABCs by the time the other ASICs become available\n - HCCStarV1\n - Unprobed early January, around 490\n - Probed end of February, 490, available at Penn\n - AMACStar\n - Unprobed early January, around 430\n - Probed end of February, 430, available at Penn\n- Powerboards\n - Barrel (PBv3.1b)\n - Requested: three batches: \n - Batch 1 (unprobed, would be *started* early January; LBNL)\n - 20 fast tracked (bPol V4), could come out of previous 50 PBv3.1, can be turned into powerboards within a week after receiving chips)\n - 100 for reliability testing (bPol V6)\n - 180 (bPol V4) for hybrid testing\n - Boards for community should be available within 4 weeks of receiving chips\n - Expected to be available for community early February\n - Batch 2 (probed, early March; LBNL)\n - 180 (bPol V4)\n - Boards for community should be available within 4 weeks of receiving chips\n - Batch 3 (probed, pre-irradiated, May/June; LBNL)\n - 390 (bPol V4) \n - Boards for community should be available within 6 weeks of receiving chips\n - Will probably need ramp-up\n - Using 50 old flexes for fast tracked batch\n - EC (all flavours)\n - Modules: 273 AMAC for all modules (without yields)\n - Getting enough powerboard flexes to need 393 AMAC to populate all\n - Hybrid panel powerboards (single testing + crates): 210 + spares \n - With yield 280 AMACs (for powerboards dedicated for testing)\n - 50 with AMABv2a in hand for start of production, will be replaced throughout PPB\n - 2 flex batches, Q4 2021 and Q1 2022\n - SMD population in same batches\n - AMAC and GanFet gluing and bonding in house, so more flexible\n - Q4-2021 batch fully populated probably end January 2022\n - Q1-2022 batch fully populated probably April 2022\n - Big production batch Q4 2022\n- Hybrids\n - Barrel\n - First batch of flexes ~December 2021; at best fully SMD populated hybrids mid February at Liverpool\n - Maybe a couple of weeks behind powerboard production\n - EC\n - EC first batch Q4 2021, next batch Q1 2022\n - SMD population probably by end of January (if delivered in December 2021); or beginning of February if delivery is delayed\n - Timeline in Freiburg: two weeks after handing over the tendering document, parts can be sent out \n - Not talked to Wuerth et to understand actual delivery of Q4 batch (powerboards + hybrids)\n- Sensors\n - Barrel\n - EC\n- Hybrid panels\n - Barrel\n - EC\n- Module Frames\n - Barrel\n - EC\n- \nNeed to combine barrel and endcap schedules together for the die distribution of the wafers\nBarrel needs 270 die from first wafer, leaves 200 die for EC\n### Endcap panel readout issues\n- Luise: might make sense to only bond one pair of hybrids per test panel to reduce risk during shipping; if hybrids are moved it might make sense to split the panels up \n- Dennis: sent out enough panels to make sure each pair of hybrids can sit on an individual panel, so there should be enough, but hopes it shouldn\u2019t make a difference\n- Dennis: hard to debug from slides, would be good to have a debug session\n - William: yes, that would be good\n- Ash: resistance is probably a red herring (similar resistance for bus tapes and they work fine). Are they V0 or V1\n - William: V0 for all hybrids, for Prototyping\n - Ash: are you using internal counters for thresholds etc or are you using full bandwidth (GUI or command line)\n - Ash: suggests to use command line instead of GUI to avoid bandwidth problems\n### Two-row HV tab bonding\n- Add 2-row bonding as recommendation to procedure document\n- Ben: Do you set deformation limit?\n - Kirsten: no, use fixed deformation level that will never be reached and run for the full time\n - Forest: sort of self-limits and set deformation\n- Ben: using bond delay before application of ultrasonic power\n - Kirsten: 50 ms ramp time\n - Forest: also running in step by step mode\n- Bart: what to do with qualification in terms of bond pattern?\n - Kirsten: revise procedure document to allow more bonds\n - We will not change the requirements. The requirement is to reach x g and we will not change how much people have to achieve, they can use the bond pattern they want to achieve it\n - Bart: is there a trend in pull results?\n - Kirsten: last results are from a different batch\n- Gerrit: should wait before including this in procedure document\n - Luise: only add this as an option to use more bonds\n - Forest: hesitation that groups might go straight to more bonds and not actually produce as high quality bonds with less number of welds\n - Bart: propose to keep the single row of bonds for qualification and then afterwards allow groups to increase number of bonds\n - Forest: agrees that groups should try to pass with a single row of bonds and only if that fails, discussion about how to improve this by maybe adding another row should take place\n - Gerrit: also agrees to single row for SQ\n - Bart: this is the most R&D like process\n - Kirsten: lot of feedback from groups that they can\u2019t reach the requirements with a single row, so this would help those groups\u000bLikes the idea from Forest to allow this in certain circumstances if single row bonds fail\n - Gerrit: groups use different waffle tools and the strength of this study depends highly on the used wedge\n- Sergio: objective is to reach HV-tabs with required bond strength and need to make sure that every institute is able to reach this\n - Forest: see second row as insurance, not as necessary to reach the required parameters\n - Sergio: there are clear differences between the groups and there is no single set of parameters or tools that work, so should do whatever necessary to get the tabs welded to the specification;\u000bDon\u2019t think we should limit groups here in terms of number of welds or rows to reach this stage\n - Luise: require that the strength of the tab is sufficient and allow people to use 2 rows to strengthen bond\n- Luise: proposal: if you reach pull strength in one row, that is good and you can use a second row to strengthen to bond, but if you don\u2019t you are allowed to use a second row of bonds to reach the target (and explain that in your SQ document), we mainly require people to show that they reach the required strength\n### Metrology - ASIC Numbering\n- Vitaliy and Tony: would prefer not to change the HCC ID\n - Support flipping the order of Y hybrids\n- Would updating the scheme mean people have to re-upload to the database?\n - Sven: keep in mind it\u2019s only a map, it doesn\u2019t affect anything else\n- Dennis: wants to have the numbers written on the PCB used\n- Karola: currently almost no end-cap hybrids written into the database, so it doesn\u2019t matter too much\n- No need to update things in the database - can just decide to change things going forward without updating the previous ones\n- Karola: haven\u2019t even started making PPA hybrids yet\n- Tony: Proposed new scheme makes sense\n- Dennis: R2 is a special case where ABCs can count from 0 to 11, would like HCC numbers switched\n- Sven: proposing to change them to 2 and 3\n### AOB\n- Carles: can people please check the EDMS chip tray review?\n- Tony: were there enough comments from the US for the barrel chip tray? \n - No, no comments from institute which produces tools\n-",
