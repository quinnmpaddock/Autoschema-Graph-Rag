Mechanical supports come from Freiburg?\n - Yes, they come from Freiburg\n- R4 tool production\n - Some pins do not fit the bushings, iterating with company\n - Pins fit into bushings outside of tool\n - Positions or angles of holes might be at fault\n - Rest of metrology looks good\n- EC PPA/prototype hybrid order\n - Hybrids are cleaned, not yet in DB\n - RFID spreadsheet is prepared\n - Ca hybrids for fast track modules are sent\n- Endcap module thermal cycling setup\n - Work ongoing, progressing\n- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out\n - Further tests have been performed\n - Cooling works well\n - Parts for beta testers nearly finished, will send by end of week\n - Will to to RAL, Liv, Toronto, SCIPP, please send shipping addresses\n - Fan procurement?\n - Manufacturer is lacking parts\n - Ordered from supplier, expect few week delivery time\n- Production of bonding and testing jigs\n - All in prod\n - Bonding jigs prioritised\n - Testing jigs to follow\n - Stencils are also in prod, should be pushed in prio if possible\n- Production of LED bars\n - Focussed on hybrids and shipping last week, no progress on LED bars yet, next thing up\n- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order\n - Order placed for SMD populations, waiting for return of boards\n### Coldjig software scheduling\n- Influx and grafana run where?\n - Assuming to run on another PC\n- How does data from there end up in DB?\n - Discussing with Christian Appelt and Bruce Gallop\n - ITSDAQ will run scripts after test finalisation and upload the data also from the local influx instance\n- Which versions of grafana / influx?\n - There is a new python influx lib which can talk with 1.8 and 2.0, so we get out of the release catch\n - Some recommendations?\n - Not really no strong prefs and lib above gets out out of the 1 vs 2 issue\n - It is not gonna work for influx 1.7! Need 1.8 at least\n- For the releases - will you inform the module list? And what if things slip?\n - Yes will send email to module list when new release is made\n - Maybe add tasktracker items for each of the release versions?\n - That sounds good!\n### Hybrid Package Height\n- Spec we have is on glue height +-40\u00b5m but doesn\u2019t take total package height into account\n- Even with tools specs being +-10\u00b5m, operator error can resolve in deviations bigger than 20\u00b5m\n- If we only measure glue height (and it is within +-40\u00b5m), the total package height might still be off by more than 20\u00b5m\n- Tony thinks taking into account measurement uncertainties and biases in measurement, we need to allow larger deviations than 20\u00b5m\n- Craig suggestion: Make sure people measure everything during pre-production on assembly jig, allow 40\u00b5m deviations, figure out with more statistics if it has to be tightened \n - Important to see effects of measuring on panel or on jig (and how this would affect workflow)\n- Kirsten proposal: measure ASIC glue thickness as before, only to stack-up measurement if glue thickness is lower than 80um\n - Craig: issue is that this only will be measured when something fails, so we will not get enough statistic\n- Gerrit: would be best to do measurements on hybrid assembly jigs and this will not affect flow too much; propose to do measurements in pre-production always on jigs\n - Maybe do it also on panel and compare results\n- Craig: during pre-production rates are not so high, so can do measurements on hybrid assembly jig\n- Vitaliy: would need to have a special jig to do metrology of multiple hybrids in a single go (e.g. modifies hybrid panel jig)\n- Chose tolerance for pre-production of package height of +/-40um\n- Suggestion Tony: Aim for 20\u00b5m, set 40\u00b5m as allowed spec\n - Do measurement both, on jig (required) and on panel (bonus)\n### AOB\n-",
