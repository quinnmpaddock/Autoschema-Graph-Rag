Work will start on Wednesday this week. Probably finished by end of this week/early next.\n- R3 tool production\n - No news, all tools and spares received, no negative feedback\n - Site quali steps finished\n - Will close task\n- R5 tool production\n - Same as for R3\n - Will close task\n- EC PPA/prototype hybrid order\n - Toronto short of some PPA PBs\n - Dennis is awaiting return from SMD stuffing, 2 rounds ongoing\n - Some more PBs expected back from Wuerth in a week and will then go for stuffing\n- Barrel hybrid tendering/order\n - Approaching some closure finally\n - Ash has purchase order in hand\n - Minor hiccups remain, details being finalised\n- EC hybrids/powerboard tendering\n - Contracts are signed\n - Does not include SMD assembly. Wuerth did not bid on that\n - Freiburg Uni will now start SMD tender\n - So this task cannot close until this is done?\n - Or we could do a \u201cjust SMD tender\u201d task and close this \u2714\n - Task \n - PB designs in EDMS review now\n - Hybrids to follow\n - Wuerth also checking designs in parallel\n - Passive components in hand\n - Uli is time constrained due to other tasks, so SMD tender might proceed at less than foll speed\n - Can we find someone to help Uli?\n- Endcap module thermal cycling setup\t\n - Executive summary:\n - All jig components in hand.\n - All coldbox plates in hand.\n - Coldboxes being assembled this week.\n - Jigplates being assembled in past weeks with the help of Cesar Boldrini (Prague). Big thanks to him.\n - Mike Muschak (Dortmund) coming on Oct 18th to work on the electronics and cabling.\n - Expect rollout done by end of Jan2022, with some sites getting their boxes earlier as boxes will be sent as soon as assembled (preference will be given to sites that provided help of course)\n- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out\n - most of parts are machined\n - front panels received, but require polishing\n - in about 2 weeks should be able to ship parts\n- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation\n - need further updates from groups using them\n - RFIDs can be supplied if they are missing\n - so far, no change for PPB required\n - need feedback with 640MBit\n- EC multiple module box transport box\n - EDMS review ongoing, please check\n- Production of R0 and R1 test frames\n - Need to run tests with modules\n - Time estimate about another month\n- Production of R2 test frames\n - Need to run tests with modules\n - Time estimate about another month\n- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames\n - Need to run tests with modules\n - Time estimate about another month\n- EC glass dummy sensors\n - Richard Brenner: R1/3 Glass sensors shipped to clusters last week.\n - Dortmund order just started\n - Have to re-open task (have contacted Dave)\n### Powerboard Reception Tests\n- Gerrit is impressed by the level of provided support\n- Have powerboard been sent with them? Zhicai: working on getting more ready, need to fix resistors\n- Do the instructions require that powerboards are connected to the reception test setups or can this be done without powerboards? Gerrit: there is a self-test-mode that can be used if no powerboard is connected\n- Sven: could you create a Twiki page with this information so that people can find this information on the Twiki rather than having to look up a talk? Zhicai says yes\nTask: for Zhicai: make a Twiki page for powerboard test setups\n- Will these instructions work for the end-cap as well? Dennis: will need a config change, but otherwise yes\n### Celestica Hybrid Bonding Experience\n- Will not build all spare hybrids that were requested by PM (e.g. one spare for each module assembly site in case something goes wrong)\n- Luise: postpone discussion about hybrid numbers and spares until Monday (dedicated meeting)\n- Follow-up question: possible to wait for R4 tools to build R4 hybrids? No, already built, but ASIC positions should be okay, just waiting for tools to place hybrids on panel\n- Ash: recommends to not use the current way of laser cutting hybrids in panel, because method found to cause lots of problems. \n - Dennis: company says change would be a problem and most customers from company prefer this way, changes would be high risk, because population would have to be tested again\n - Ash: can be difficult to remove because cutting all the layers can be strong, suggestion to remove solder resist in areas where it needs to be cut\n - Dennis: could be done - could remove the solder resist from the cut areas\n - Dennis: anything that makes it easier to break the hybrid out of the panel makes them more difficult to populate, so it\u2019ll be a trade-off\n - Dennis: used to have shorter tabs which made them easier to handle and back then, some hybrids fell out of the array\n- Vitaliy: regarding database attachments: seems a pervasive problem, do not expect a quick fix\n - Sven: can you attach test results to bare panels? After some upload tests, files were accessible through the API, just not through the Web GUI\n - Luise: suggest e-mail to database list if there is no response to submitted ticket\n### AOB\n- Tony: it\u2019s been eight years of Ingo\u2019s module AC-ship - thanks for all the hard work!",
