(global shortage of Si parts makes unavailability, in the near future, likely - see e.g. the MicroZed board (current delivery time: 52 weeks))\n### Reclassification for the ABCStarv1 wafers probed by Carleton\n- Test fixes recovered a lot of ASICs in the maps, please use updated probing maps\n### End-cap coldbox PCB\n- Lund will check if they can include the humidity sensors in their order and deliver to sites\n### AMAC current measurement & referencing caps\n- Dave postponed to next week\n### AOB\n- n",
