I think it would be useful to discuss them? \n - Cole: I would like this but i'm not sure what the tests are\n - Vitaly: I don't understand the test, I would like a discussion \n - Bruce: I think we didn't have time today but its something for the future\n - Vitaly: we have started the PRESERIES so we need this now\n - Bruce: We haven't agreed how to do the power cycling and we need to agree\n- William: what is the plan for the tools, is there going to be some edms documentation for how to sue shims ext\n - Cole: yes we should do this\n - William: We have set the target height via email but we need to write them down.\n### L4 Updates\n#### Production Management\nPresenter: Abe\n- Gabriele: Nice presentation, let's assume something goes wrong at a site, can the components be redirected. Is there a standardized way to do this? \n - Abe: I think it\u2019s cluster-dependent and there is no standard mechanism. For the US example, it\u2019s easier because all the parts will be in the US and module sites can ship to each other.\n - Gabriele: It will not be part of the component flow it will be cluster dependant \n - Abe: For this example, yeah.\n- William: The challenge we are facing is that we got 1200 panels from Freiburg, but when we try to receive that many at once, the DB times out. So we are reprogramming to do this in chunks. That\u2019s why these things are in transit.\n - Abe: thanks for clarifying\n- Ewan: Do you get your numbers from the DB or from Kates reporting? They want to change this to once a week update, we want it once a day. Does this match with what you want?\n - Abe: The numbers I check for inventory come from the inventory page in our reporting. So in general, it\u2019s nice to have it up to date often, but for the quarterly shipment, it would only need to be up to date here.\n- Andy: To clarify: when the ASICs or there is any change in the cluster this is the cluster responsibility, why would you need a daily update for a quarterly shipment.\n - Cole: the daily reporting is important to debug the reporting but not necessary for the quarterly shipping\n- Bruce: That\u2019s probably something we are feeding back, the daily updates are more diagnostic. Doing it daily doesn\u2019t matter. The important thing is that if we know the things that are needed frequently, can we write things in a way that doesn't iterate over every component in the DB.\n - Cole: for certain components this is done, there are reports for modules/ hybrids, more modularity might improve that\n - Bruce: I mean every component, even if you\u2019re not iterating over the ASICs, it might be useful to cut things back.\n - Ewan: when we run a script we run it for the module so its updating test info and everything. When we save things to our intermediate DB it helps but a lot of work would need to go in to change it to just one module\n - Bruce: I just need to know what the use cases are. At the moment it sounds like it might be a quarterly thing. Knowing how things work is useful.\n- Jaya John: The vancouver framework does not sit on everyone's computer it just runs once a day and when people access it they just access the influx website which doesn't use the actual DB\n### Group Update: Scandinavia\nPresenter: Oliver McRoy\n- Cole: For the chiller you are doing fine, when it goes warm it closes the valve. For getting cold enough you might want to increase your current to 7 amps\n - Oliver is there instructions\n - Cole: yes it's all online\n- Craig W: We were going to have a chat about MBI, can we talk about this after?\n - Cole: sounds good \nPresenter: Geoffrey Mullier\n- William: The target glue is 20 - 25% more for the density or UV glue because it's much worse to have less glue than more, we have not had any squeeze out like that with our ones\n - Geoffrey: That was the one where we were way-below targets. It was because the original dots were ridiculous because you had less than half of the glue.\n - William: There is an elaborate table and we put 20-25% more to make sure it's stuck down. We should be at -5 because the dispensing is tricky\n - Geoffrey: For the R2 for instance, it was -20, so it was way too little, but it cured.\n### Discussion: Grounding\nPresenter: Navid\n- Carles: For grounding the anodized tools, do we have any measurements for how this removes electrical charge? Is it conducted to the inner?\n - Navid: No measurements. Are you saying we need them to justify this?\n - Carles: If the anodization is an insulator, I don\u2019t see how it can be conducted to the hybrid/PB. But we measured the ESD charge before this and we never saw a significant charge. But I was curious about how useful this grounding is.\n - Navid: You have deionizers set up?\n - Carles: We look at the charge.\n- Carles: Is it possible to include which pads are ground in the bonding diagrams so we don\u2019t need to guess.\n - Navid: I\u2019ll add those images to the bonding documents. That should define which pads get bonded first.\n - Navid: It\u2019s a small overhead to ground the tools and this had been specified previously, I think we should just do this. Does anyone object?\n - Pete S: One of my questions is that it\u2019s kinda difficult to ground the pickup tools, there isn\u2019t really a port. Will they be required to be grounded?\n - Navid: We have a ground screw.\n - Pete: Was that part of the design?\n - Navid: I don\u2019t think so, I think we added it.\n - Pete: It raises another question, if we are concerned about charge building up on these tools, would it not be simpler to treat them with the deionizer?\n - Navid: I would agree, but it would require sites to buy more of these.\n - Carles: Then we should make sure that grounding actually helps, or is needed. If you build up charge on an insulator, how can it get to the inside of the tool? I don\u2019t see that.\n- William: Adding the wires has the risk of it flopping around. We have coiled vacuum tools, so I\u2019m not sure we can get those in there. At some point, it could break bond wires. We don\u2019t know the risk of ESD either.\n - Navid: can you not switch to the \u2026\n - William: No, we can\u2019t start over\n - Tony: With coiled ones, run it down the center works great.\n - Navid: It\u2019s the same risk of vacuum tubes.\n - William: It\u2019s more at least. We will look at it, but we aren\u2019t sure we can do it.\n - Navid: The deionizer is costly for some sites\n - William: It\u2019s costly to have Celestica change things\n- Vitality: I\u2019m surprised grounding tools is a topic, wasn\u2019t this part of SQ?\n - Navid: Not according to the documentation. A lot of folks thought it was, but it isn\u2019t specified.\n - Vitaliy: Deionizing is important. It\u2019s not only ASICs since you can induce trapped charge which is floating. So it can acquire high voltage that induces noise or EBD. I know some sites are restricted in what they can buy, but the nominal unit is only about $100. \n - Navid: Different sites have treatment methods we should collect and we should create a specification.\n - Vitaliy: We have a Twiki page for this\n- Tristan: I have a question about deionizing. Looking at the models I\u2019ve seen so far, they are a little different to the model we have. The question I have, do they blow positive or negative ions? Ours has the option to do either.\n - Navid: Good point, I\u2019ll check ours, does anyone else know?\n- Tristan: For grounding cables etc, there is the option to ground ankle straps, which requires an ESD floor/mat to avoid having too many wires at the bench level.\n - Navid: If you have the setup showing grounding with bracelets, you would have it running to your coat. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done to mitigate the problem. \n - Tristan: If the wires are not an option, then this works.\n- Navid: Seems there are people pushing back on the tooling grounding.\n - William: We will try this, but it may not be possible with the constraints we have. I\u2019m not sure we can reopen SQ for this though.\n- Forest: Is there any thought on shorting connectors for frames/panels/etc.?\n - Navid: What do you mean?\n - Forest: When we move parts around and plug/unplug, for handling transistors without protection, in the past, we\u2019ve always grounded/shorted/set potential. For example, take a frame, plug on a shorting connector, wirebond to a frame, then put it in storage/next station. Then that contact would be brought to ground, then the object removed [describes steps but it\u2019s hard to type]. More or less, you would always keep the components shorted together so that no external connection could be brought to a higher potential so it\u2019s safe.\n - Navid: I haven\u2019t thought of this, but it\u2019s potentially a good idea [unintentional pun]\n - Forest: I think controlling the object might have some benefits.\n - Tony: I think doing the simple right things is the thing we should do. I don\u2019t see a wide spread of evidence to say we have a problem with ESD. You push this safety based on what you\u2019re experiencing and what modes you could have to generate this static charge. As far as I can see, bonding in the right order and grounding the tools should solve the majority of problems.\n - Navid: We do still have EBD.\n - Tony: But we deionize. Depending on where you buy your components, it\u2019s usually less expensive than a module or two, or the wasted time from a few extra IVs, so it\u2019s definitely worth it.\nPresenter: Simon Pyatt\n- William: We do have dry storage that is grounded, we\u2019ve checked it. We\u2019ve spent all this money. It\u2019s a huge overhead to replace all of this. We would need to see actual failures pointing to this.\n - Navid: We aren\u2019t suggesting re-outfitting the cleanroom.\n - William: We\u2019ve tested most of these things, but we\u2019ve only seen one or two failures that might be ESD. I\u2019m just not sure how far we can go.\n - Simon: This is just how we do it in the UK.\n - Tony: I\u2019m not quite sure why you\u2019re doing this. Grounding the racks makes sense. Having a grounded connector to each hybrid panel or module, this is going to make things impossible for modules. For hybrids, it might be fine. What problem are we trying to solve with this? What path do you think is the problem here? You\u2019re more likely to have a problem with someone connecting themselves. I think you\u2019re adding a risk with no benefit. \n - Simon: I\u2019m not a fan of too many leads myself, but this is a general discussion. So the question is if it\u2019s worth the extra effort.\n - Tony: You could short everything which might have some benefit, but it\u2019s a lot of connectors and keeping track of them. Logically you would want them for module frames and hybrid panels. This would cost quite a bit of money and a lot of time to implement this. We should at least have some benefit before requiring this. ESD problems are usually hard to pin down, but there are a few cases like the bonding order where we can point to that being a problem and it was noticeable.\n - Simon: Would it be of benefit to perhaps do a talk where we\u2019ve proven it would be useful?\n - Tony: There have been cases where we changed something and the failure has gone away, some cases you could see the blown wires. The only case we know of is lines in the AMAC due to bond order. So you could ask Berkley to show what they saw. That makes sense, in this case unless you put your hand on the connector.\n - Navid: It might be nice to see a Berkeley presentation. I don\u2019t think anyone is against the bonding order\n - Tony: The bonding has to be the dominant thing because you touch the pads. If the sensor is charged up and you bond, you can transmit current. The amount of charge you can have is less than a big metal bonder. That\u2019s how I think about it.\n - William: Tony and I are agreeing. At Celestica, doing something that is more dangerous than potential ESD, like adding this wire, might be a bigger problem than we are trying to solve.\n - Navid: Good to hear you plan to look into it.\n- Vitaliy: The problem with ESD issues is that they are difficult to pin down deterministically. Otherwise it would be easy to debug. They can happen of course, and have seen a few reports for ASICs, where they had to be replaced. There isn\u2019t proof unfortunately. \n - Navid: I don\u2019t think we are going to realistically prove a case on this. What we can do is implement some of these mitigations to get us close to where the issues are. Otherwise, ESD will remain a question.\n - Vitaliy: If we do see problems, we should see if ESD precautions should be revisited.\n- Pete: With regards to EC pickup tools, it\u2019s not trivial to add a ground to these tools. That\u2019s why we are questioning this.\n - Navid: To try and wrap this up: It won\u2019t be trivial, but people are willing to look into some of these methods, then we can have a discussion about this.\n - Tony: The best place to put this connector is right next to the light [?]. Can you put a round lug where you plug the light through? You can either use a crimp or possible banana plugs. The handling after that shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\n - Pete: Our tools don\u2019t sit permanently in one spot, which does cause us some issues.\n - Tony: Right, extra tools compared to the barrel\n- Navid: We would like people to fill out a sheet with some of their ESD precautions, and what sites can (or cannot) do. For deionizing, we should specify what we\u2019re going to do with that. We can\u2019t quite make everyone have a deionizer at each station, but we\u2019ll see how far we can get. Does anyone have any issues with that?\n - William: The Barrel is in preseries, and the EC is about to start. We can\u2019t stop things \u2026\n - Navid: There is no suggestion to stop anyone doing anything.",
