So please don\u2019t just do the reception, please send an update right after.\n### L4 Updates\n#### Topic\nPresenter: Abe Tishelman-Charney\n- Vitaliy: Is there anyone who wants sensors? When would be the time to start sending out the sensors to the module AC sites. \n - Abe: Can\u2019t answer that now, but we can get back to you\n - Vitaliy: That would be good.\n- William: I asked in the fall if we were going to receive more sensors. We have the time. Sooner is better than later.\n - Cole: excellent, then will send more sooner rather than later\n- Ingo (messages): Zeuthen would be very happy to receive more sensors - just sent a plea to the ACs :)\n- Roland (messages): Freiburg also has capabilities to store more sensors although we are not yet site qualified to assemble actual modules\u2026\n- Marta (messages): Also Dortmund we have capabilities to store more sensors\n### Group Update\n#### Edd for Ral\n- Ash: Were those hybrids recoverable?\n - Edd: I\u2019m not entirely sure, but we can get back to you [missed it]\n- William: on previous slides, there was serial number of the module on the frame - do the barrel modules have identification (ours have RFIDs). We\u2019ve had problems because we put label on covers and then exchange the covers and then they don\u2019t match anymore\n - Cole: isn\u2019t the RFID under the 22 on the label?\n - Ash: yes\n - William: may be easier to use the RFID tag, more difficult to mix up\n#### Xin for IHEP\n- Vitaly: You called it an \u201celectronics box\u201d, is it actually a desiccant box? The unit that makes dry air.\n - Xin: Actually no, we opened it. It has one side that couldn\u2019t open anymore.\n - Vitaliy: I think it is a desiccant system and I think the actuator failing is a known failure mode\n - Bart: Yes, the system consists of a desiccant and a mechanism and the desiccant is fine, the mechanism is fine, it was only the hatch that didn\u2019t open - that part failed (in several cabinets at once) and was replaced and now all is good again\n - Xin: Yes\n - Vitaliy: I only ask because we saw other failure modes as well.\n### HBIPC Assembly\nPresenter: Kirsten Affolder\n- Sven: The hole on the connector side looks covered by the cover. Can you still put a screw on there?\n - Kirsten: Yes, you can. It\u2019s not quite covered, it still fits into the shipping crates\n- William: On slide 9, the picture of the crate. How do these things work? The Hybrid test panels go in the slot?\n - Kirsten: This is just for storing. The crate is built off this standard crate.\n - William: Got it, thanks.\n - Kirsten: We bought a lot of extra ones so that we can store hybrids on panels while we are waiting for bonding. The plate holds the HBIPCs.\n- Theo: For the plastic covers, are they easy to remove and attach say if you needed to rebond the IDs?\n - Kirsten: Yes. There is epoxy. They overhang the edge of the board by about a mm. So there is a line of epoxy \u2026 we do it upside down. You can cut it with a scalpel and it will pop off\n- Ben Bruers: You said we can lower the voltage to 7V. This is probably something we could work into the hybrid testing and ITSDAQ.\n - Ingo: It would make sense for the PBs that have issues, but I don\u2019t know about elsewhere. It might not be representative.\n - Vitaliy: The assumption here is that you still get 1.5V to hybrid.\n - Ben: And the reason is that unlike with a\u2026 why don\u2019t you need 11V like you do on the module?\n - Vitaliy: 11V is the \u201cusual\u201d operating condition. \n - Forest: I thought that with a smaller step-down in voltage, there is less to dissipate\n - Craig: On the module/stave, you care about the voltage drop, which is why we run it a bit higher. With shorter cables, it might be fine.\n - Peter: Do you hit the PS limit with a full crate?\n - General laughter\n - Sven: ITk Week should give us four panels, so we can try that.\n - Vitaliy: The 7V was just a one-off test, but we should check.\n- Peter P: Are those 3D-printed covers static dissipative?\n - Kirsten: They are not\n - Peter: I\u2019m bothered by that. They might store charge. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good practice.\n - Vitaliy: in principle yes, but it isn\u2019t connected to anything\n - Cole: could get PLA - not super expensive and might be worth it\n - Craig: I would prefer it.\n - Vitaliy: do you want us to replace the existing ones?\n - Ben: Dennis, the covers we use now for the EC, are those ESD safe?\n - Dennis: no, they are not\n - Ben: if we have ever seen anything, it hasn\u2019t happened very often\n - Peter: It\u2019s the adjacent hybrids that worry me.\n - Ben: also haven\u2019t seen any broken hybrids\n - Peter: I think there are things that have happened at the module level that could be consistent with ESD damage.\n - Vitaliy: struggling to come up with an electrical path that would work. Charge is very far away from hybrids. Would need hundreds of kilovolts.\n - Cole: may someone could make a few ES-safe PLA ones\n - Peter: we\u2019re also not supposed to have non-ESD safe stuff in cleanroom anyway\n - Cole: maybe RAL can print some - SCIPP, can you send these?\n- Gerrit: This might be more of a question for Vitaliy, I am disturbed by how hot things are running on these PBs. I don\u2019t know if we ever measured this properly on the module. For the linPol, is this according to design specs? It seems to be really hot.\n - Fadeyev: it\u2019s hot, wouldn\u2019t claim that this is a precise measurement - several involved factors. Systematic bias because the system isn\u2019t cooled (no air flow), so they look hotter than they would in a detector. Remember this from the first series of powerboards: if we test them without cooling them, they get quite hot.\n - Gerrit: I can\u2019t remember the last time we checked a module with the PBs fully operational. It\u2019s more difficult because you have to spray paint them black.\n - Ash: this would be problematic for the linPOL, because dropping an excess of 3 V across the component, so decreasing input voltage will help here to decrease power dissipation. That\u2019s why it gets so hot. Cooling should be provided by air - not sure what else can be done. \n - Vitaliy: looked into this at some point, doing something like a metal plate for heat dissipation onto powerboards, but decided it was overkill\n - Gerrit: What would be the issue from dropping the voltage?\n - Ash: The efficiency of the buck converter. The dissipation on the converter will go up, but I\u2019m not sure by how much.\n - Cole: probably need to study this more to understand what\u2019s going on\n - Ash: linPol is the bigger concern\n - Vitaliy: I think your issue is with the full system, and here is the HBI?\n - Ash: I\u2019m concerned about burn-in, in detector we have cooling\n - Gerrit: Okay, so we are stuck with 10V on module/stave\n - Ash: yes, keep current draw down\n- Theo: For the covers, we have this special tool to handle the PBs in the UK. Would that still fit with the new cover?\n - Fadeyev: we have a tool people use, don\u2019t recall if it is the same\n - Kirsten: We did not, we just used the level.\n - Gerrit: never used the tool\n - Vitaliy: Some use it, so maybe we should check.\n - Kirsten: have one, will check\n - Craig: At the risk of sounding like a broken record, those tools are not ESD safe and the tools do go along the hybrid and could easily build up charge.\n - Theo: if that\u2019s the case, can we redesign the tools and make them fit and ESD safe?\n - Cole: suggest to take this offline\n### Recurring Discussion: Module QC Chain\nPresenter: Cole Helling\n- Ben: Is there a tool around from the DB side to show that a module has had all the tests at the proper stages\n - Luise: There are two tools, one is Kenny\u2019s tool and there is Christian\u2019s and Bruce\u2019s web app which also gives summary information\n - Ingo: Can we have the same thing in code? Something scriptable?\n - Ben: We have that in Zeuthen?\n - Bruce: What is this specifically?\n - Ben: Ingo wants to have a script where you give it a serial number and it tells you if it missed/failed tests\n - Bruce: The nice thing about a web page is that there is no need to update. If you have a way around that \u2026\n - Ben: Ingo wants to integrate it with our flow, so would like to do it with a command line call.\n - Bruce: if we can call the web page from the command line - would that work?\n - Ben: That would probably work.\n - Bruce: We would just work out what to do.\n - Ben: does this work for one component at a time or for lists of modules?\n - Cole: The web page only works for one component at a time, but it has a lot of information and all the bits seem to be there. Agree very strongly that we want a web page so that people don\u2019t use an outdated version of code.\n- William: I heard Ben asking two questions: Can we get an overview of all tests and stages? But the other one is \u201cdoes it pass?\u201d If we have a lot of tests and stages, we need some kind of yes or no. But the first step is to decide. I\u2019m assuming we don\u2019t have something like this.\n - Bruce: The idea is that it is. So if folks have ideas to make it better we want to hear it.\n - William: [missed it]\n - Bruce: Yeah, we need to check that this is using the right version and all.\n - Cole: good starting point for this discussion, need to get started on these visualisation tools\n- Bart: Regarding pass/fail, hopefully the non-experts can run these tests where the user can see the final verdict green/orange/red to tell us.\n - Cole: agree, currently working on a machine which builds all of this, sorting out details with Bruce and Peter, need something that is very clearly a pass or fail\n - Ben: In HBI we have a button that turns red or green based on the pass/fail. I haven\u2019t activated it but it should go soon.\n - Ingo: I asked for what has to be uploaded\u2026 with your merge tool, it\u2019s easy to upload the tests from the merge. There is no tool for the upload though.\n - Cole: agree, wrote my own tool, will share if there is interest, can share during the week after ITk Week\n - Ingo: that would be great, especially if it is scriptable\n - Cole: it\u2019s a web page, but translatable\n - Ben: didn\u2019t you want to have a button for single module tests in ITSDAQ which is then uploaded?\n - Cole: yes I wanted to, but no one else was interested\n - Ben: upload could be automatic\n - Peter: If everything passes, it should just upload automatically.\n - Ben: Then we should integrate this into the tests.\n- Marta: completely agree. For the SMT, I was assuming there was a full test function.\n - Peter: I\u2019ve forgotten the OCS, if we put it on the feature requests, then we can put that in.\n - Marta: that would make sense\n### AOB\n- ECR Flash talks\n- Endcap discussion decision at ITk Week",
