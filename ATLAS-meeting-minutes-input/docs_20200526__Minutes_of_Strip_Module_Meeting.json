(Luise)\n- Can we use DSC for site specific QC?\n - Probably not - preparing samples locally probably has more variation\n- Anybody not want to use bottles?\n - No complaints\n - Baseline ordering 3 times during production\n- What about shelf life etc.?\n - Should be 1 year but may like to evaluate changes with time etc.\n - Should confirm storage/freezing etc.\n - Data sheet says open containers should be purged with N2 for storage\n - Glue should be stored in dry storage solutions!!\n - Storage with components may need to be avoided\n- Conclusion\n - we go to bottles, Luise will send instructions\n - We will evaluate deep freezing polaris\n - We will check out dry storage gas out / store away from module components\n### EC hybrid/module progress (Dennis)\n- Does the design flaw comment apply to hybrids?\n - No, some hybrids had to have fixes applied due to routing errors\n - New batch of hybrids will be made so that those being sent out to EC groups will not need these fixes\n- What is the copper weight difference on powerboards?\n - R0 asked for 35um on all layers - in end got 28um on outer layers, not sure about inner\n - Other is 18um or even less (same panel as hybrids)\n- How controlled is the glue thickness?\n - Not at all - should be measured to compare to noise results\n- Table of capacitance per module to be made for adding results to noise summary plot\n### QC groups: weighing (weighing QC group)\n- Noted that may need to check scale calibrations\n - Reference weights can be purchased and are not crazy expensive\n- Strong support for weighing lots now to look towards reducing amount of weighing in future\n### QC groups: bond pulling (bond pulling QC group)\n- To 4th June\n### QC groups: electrical test (electrical test QC group)\n- To 4th June\n### AoB\n- None",
