Yes, will contact later\n - Ingo: cold box: you don\u2019t use isolation pad? Laurelle: just a quick test and with back plexiglass cover on.\n - Gerrit: slide 5. Tools starting to tilt: we suspend vacuum lines from the top. Also seen in US that it\u2019s no good to use coiled up lines for the pickup lines (use them only for table based tools)\n - Gerrit: about tools wiggling. Check if pins go deep enough into bushings.\u000b\nNext meeting: ? \n### GUI to upload test data\n- Kenneth asks about the GUI framework.\n- Ingo: will this be merged with the web app? \n - Kenneth: will start checking and thinking how to merge\n- Ingo: all shown is for barrel modules. Do you know about anyone interested in covering EC? \u2192 No.\n### EC HVTabs - needs and available stock, current status\n- Please check your needs ASAP (or even faster :) ), and provide feedback to Carles \n### AOB\n- TonyA: At upgrade week we want to talk about descoping options for QC tests. There is a spreadsheet. Please provide feedback if you were asked for some",
