Not sure\u2026\n- Confirmation testing\n - From FDR should do confirmation test at high end of thermal cycle\n - This is what is done at reception testing\n - Use trim from database (reception testing) or previously derived one (thermal cycling)\n - Also need to add a characterisation at end of thermal cycle at 20C for comparison to reception testing (could be done at same time as HV stability)\n- What about double trigger noise or digital tests?\n - Could well be added\n - Would need to discuss with chip/DAQ people to understand what is useful on that side\n- How to define bad channels etc.?\n - Nathan has write up\n - Possible proposal to include a low bias run to enhance difference between bonded and unbonded channels for characterisation\n - Need to harmonise over all the places this is written down\n - <1% is written in the module specs\n- Reception testing\n - How to know the module that you are testing and relate to module tests\n - Idea was that DAQ can readout FuseIDs to get configuration/trims etc. from the database\n- Hybrid electrical testing\n - Ben/Ash hoping to have something to present soon\n - Should be brought to module meeting for discussion ASAP\n### HV tab bonding (Forest)\n- DESY have seen similar improvement in bonding when cores are properly cleaned\n### AoB\n- Reminder to fill out QC surveys from Karola\n## \n## Actions\n1.
