(global shortage of Si parts makes unavailability, in the near future, likely - see e.g. the MicroZed board (current delivery time: 52 weeks))\n### ABCStarv1 Classification\n- Noone present, maybe did not realise talk was moved to today from last week?\n### Powerboard test setup MicroZed shortage and HV discussion\n- Support proposed update No 1: all powerboard reception sites need a power supply capable of 550V\n- Can groups have a PC with Centos7 as a backup?\n - Not clear\n- Craig: Also need to look for other DAQ on how to proceed with Centos 7, which will stop support during production\n- Gerrit: why not use raspberry pi?\n - Karol: have looked at it\n - Gerrit: speed might be an issue\n - Dennis: USB behaviour is relatively bad, would not use for burn-in\n### Image metrology\n- Forest: using wire-bonder for z measurement, could damage wires\n - Richard: our wire-bonder uses optical measurement, not touch\n- Ingo: lens corrections might become important when using this\n - Richard: can be covered and calibrated using a smartscope measurement\n- Richard: use this method as fast feedback for industrial production at Canada or Upsala\n - Canada: will use standard metrology since it is fast enough\n### AOB\n- none",
