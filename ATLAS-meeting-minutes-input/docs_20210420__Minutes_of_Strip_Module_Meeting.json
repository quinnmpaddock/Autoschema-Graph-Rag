Will contact dedicated speakers soon\n- Introduction of new procedure document task force to push finalization of documents\n - Task force meet once a week (Wednesday) \n - Go through up to 5 documents per week and discuss issues in meeting\n - Make decisions on open points, then tidy up documents\n - EDMS review of documents\n - 48h if document had already be reviewed several times\n - 1 week if document was not reviewed\n - Will inform authors if their document is under review from the task force\n- Database dummy program will start as soon as issue with Executive user privileges in database are solved\n - Andy discussed ant already with Marek and they are going to work on it\n### Task tracker items\nUpdates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda\nAnd also task tracker for updates\n- Production of R2 toolset Urgent\n - more progress in local workshop, expect to have all parts machined within ~2 weeks\n - ramping up metrology (roping in help)\n - anodisation will follow metrology\n - will make sure anodisation shop is reminded to cover all round holes\n- Production of R4 toolset Urgent\n - Have 5 sets of tools, still doing measurements (looking into issues with optical measurements)\n - Incontact with manufacturer with regards to vacuum pattern and unmasked holes during anodizing\n- Production of R5 toolset Urgent\n - (task tracker updated)\n - Tools manufactured and anodized\n - Some tools rejected\n - Company will start mounting in 2-3 weeks\n- Production of hybrid and module tools for the US Normal\n - Just received metrology on ASIC tray and pick-up tool Y after re-machining tools\n - Need some further look into metrology\n - Need to check that ASICS fit in chip tray\n- Production of hybrid/module tools for UK/China Normal\n - All tools back from rework at Liverpool workshop\n - 7 Pick-up tools re-machined, but forgot HCC vacuum bit\n - Have enough pick-up tools for each group, so will ship them and ask workshop to have a look again at the wrong pick-up tools\n- Order of hybrids for prototyping and PPA for the endcap Urgent\n - Prototype hybrids at Freiburg (out of tender)\n- Tendering process for barrel hybrids Urgent\n - Everything frozen, probably able to release that after AUW\n - Gerbers need ASIC padrings to be frozen\n - SMD mounting of hybrid flexes should be relatively straight forward procurement process\n- Tendering process for EC hybrids and powerboards Urgent\n - Good progress on technical specification and go though review\n - Delivery plan made based on schedule\n - Might be a bit too late for start of PPB\n - Prototype hybrids at Freiburg (out of tender)\n - Need to discuss about reordering parts\n - Could be a separate SMD part of tendering\n - Powerboard part of same tendering, but does not have to be same company as hybrids\n- Design, finalisation and roll-out of powerboard testing setups Urgent\n - Layout comments on active board received, will be implemented and then start production of boards\n- Design, finalisation and roll-out of module thermal cycling setup to UK/China Urgent\n - Waiting on control electronics to be assembled\n - Then test everything to confirm functionality\n - Star delivery with preliminary software version\n- Design, finalisation and roll-out of module thermal cycling setup to US Urgent\n - - no report -\n- Hybrid crate finalisation and roll-out Urgent\n - Have done tests at Zeuthen using dummy parts\n - Fan system is currently being integrated, software and gui progress well\n - Hardware might be ready by end of April\n - Start roll out by mid May\n - Software available by end of May\n- Finalisation of panels for EC hybrid testing Urgent\n - TWiki page created with status of tested panels\n- Production of LED bars for the EC Urgent\n- order of powerboards for prototyping and PPA\n - Part of endcap hybrid order\n### Glue Dispensing\n- What is the room temperature variation?\n - Within +/-0.5 deg C\n- Room temp is set the day before the measurement, so setup should be well adjusted by the time of the measurement\n- Is 10% variation in volume too tight?\n - William: even within 15% coverage is good\n - Also inside of pick-and-place machine environment temperature is not monitored\n- The critical temperature seems to be the dispenser tip temperature\n - Very expensive units have tip temperature control\n- Situations where you might not be able to glue due to large temp fluc, how often expected?\n - Happens rarely, correlated e.g. with fires in the vicinity\n - Jane feels she cannot reliably predict the future :)\n - About 1% of the time is Vitaliy\u2019s expectation for \u201crarely\u201d\n- How about cooling rather than heating?\n - Discussion, technically challenging, adds issues with mixing\u2026\n- Would be good to repeat this measurement with epoxy\n### Reviewing site qualification steps (update)\n- Two weeks, other two weeks if feedback, then maybe another iteration\u2026 this could take forever?\n - Two weeks are the max/deadline, usually we see that this is done more quickly\n - We however are worried about this too, we might have to tighten this and/or, in some special cases, deliver PPB parts when only a central core of SQ steps are finished at a given site\n- This is going very slowly, can have financial impacts or add big delays on schedule\n- In future might reduce the number of reviewers per step in order to speed up\n - Right now cycles are fast and 3 reviewers agree, likely as deliverables are well defined. We hope we can continue this, but yes, this could be a way to speed up\n### EC tooling vacuum pattern\n- Proposed simpler vacuum pattern looks like a good alternative for workshops that find it hard to to the original pattern\n- TRIUMF will test proposed pattern on one example tool, will check for burrs and if sensor looks nice and flat when vacuumed down\n - If positive will use the simpler pattern\n - Difference: here anodised first, then grooved, for later jigs will be first groove, then anodise\n- [... More discussion not captured ...]\n### [will have to move to next module meet] Metrology Benchmarking Proposal\n- moved...\n### AOB\n- None, out of time",
