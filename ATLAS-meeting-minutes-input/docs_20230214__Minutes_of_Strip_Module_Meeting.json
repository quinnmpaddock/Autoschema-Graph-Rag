Anyone else has not received hybrids\n- William: not sure if Celestica is doing wire-bonding in the next 2 weeks. We can\u2019t ask them to do the pull tests without hybrid bonding.\n - Luise: that is fine\nSlide 4\n- Xin: for the 10 additional modules, are there requirements for the glue?\n - Luise: yes, \u00bd SE4445, \u00bd TrueBlue, both 120um glue thickness\nSlide 5\n- Gerrit: we have done metrology on all modules that are used for loading to the next stave side. All modules that were thermally cycled at BNL show this bow, modules from other US sites don\u2019t. They were all cold-cycled at the corresponding sites.\n- Modules tested at Brookhaven for a single cycle show bow\n- Tony: as SCIPP we don\u2019t go to as low a temperature\n- Gerrit: we might want to do thermal cycling of some modules from other sites to cold temperature at BNL\n- Tony: \n- Gerrit: all the modules from LBNL and SCIPP are flatt (within 50um)\n- Andy: do all US sites cycle with the same cooling rate?\n- Gerrit: we are mostly concerned with how cold we go, not the rate. We will look into this.\n- Ian: we saw that module changed shape after shipping to BNL, but could also be from cycling there\n- Gerrit: don\u2019t think it matters much and bow goes the other way when measuring them on the stave (middle higher)\n- Ian: our modules are bowing when they get cold (bonds popping)\n- Gerrit: want to find out how long after assembly the modules were tested cold\n- William: we need a finalized document for the module wire-bonding document. Is there a plan on when this is finished?\n - Luise: previous changes should have contained all updates. This is now a fairly final version and we leave it open for comments. But we will wait until all sites are in PPB to give them a chance to give comments\n - William: its not easy to go to Celestica with a document that is not final\n - Luise: for now, this is the best we can get.\n - Luise; wire-bond positions in new document are correct\n - \n### Institute Contributions\nMelbourne\n- Luise: thank you for joining at this time and it looks great\nNext meeting: LBNL\n### Wire bond ageing tests\nSlide 4\n- Luise: Bart, how would you feel about sharing hybrids for those tests\n - Bart: will need to look at\n- Tony: are there any humidity requirements? And about the thermal cycling (temperature profile\n - Sven: would pre-heat the oven and just put the objects in there\n - Tony: don\u2019t know if our ovens have humidity control\n - Bart: some could do\n - Ingo: do at normal temperature\n - Tony: don\u2019t have a means of measuring the humidity in our ovens\n### Discussion: include shunted tests in cold cycling\n- Luise: question on how to continue test for cold noise in production. Would like to include shunted tests in cold cycles to see how much headroom we have (since LS modules are less susceptible for cold noise)\n- Luise: how practical would it be to include shunted tests in cold cycles?\n- Luise: how many shunted cycles do we want in the cold cycle, since this can have effects on the possible cooling rate of the system.\n- Luise: 1) are people happy to do \n- Tony: think in the US there is no constraint\n - Ian: yes, its fine. The only issue is increasing the current components\n- Luise: has anyone in the UK tested multiple modules shunted?\n - Matt: only tested 2-3 modules shunted and then the temperature becomes an issue\n - Luise: would it then be possible to do one module in each cycle (cycling through all in the box)\n- Ashley: is there a plan to do QA to see where there is a cut off \n - Luise: the idea is to build separate modules to make these tests\n - Ashley: this then should show where the cut-off for modules is and then for QC this should be dialled down to a safe value\n - Luise: even for a good looking module, we want to do a shunted tests to see how much headroom we have\n - Luise: idea would be to run one shunted cold test and do a ratio comparison with an unshunted test.\n - Luise: how many shunted cycles are required during a cold cycle for this?\n- Ian: should be careful about which cycle we choose for the shunting, since it can cause cold noise in later cycles\n - Luise: don\u2019t want to shunt first cycle, then shunted 2-4, then unshunted, then shunted followed by the last test to be unshunted\n - Luise: don\u2019t want to be first and last to be shunted and one un-shunted inbetween\n- Ian: do we want to do power cycling during cold as part of QC or QA?\n - Luise: cold turn-on should be part of the QC\n - Ian: is it a complete cold start (including AMAC)\n - Luise: idea was to get cold (unpowered) and then turn the module on\n - Tony: thought to keep the AMAC on for temperature monitoring\n - Bart: would also be nice to do a warm test first\n - Ian: was thinking about doing a cold test at the very end to redo tuning\n - Ingo: program is in the QC document\n - Tony: in the cycle document, there is a war test first. \n - Tony: tuning for temperature is not worked out so far\n- Abraham: from software site, nothing of this is implemented as far as I know, but we want to implement this\n - Luise: is someone already working on this?\n - Abraham: not sure\n - Gerrit: it\u2019s not a requirement, so its not done. \n - Luise: it\u2019s mostly just to see how the things we agreed upon are implemented\n- Sven: do we want to do this on SS modules?\n - Luise: yes, all of them\n - Dennis: then were do we do this on endcap modules?\n - Luise: we do it on all of them\n - Dennis\n- Tony: for the shunted test, do we do the full test, or just a shunted RC test at the end?\n - Luise; that\u2019s something to be discussed with the developers.\n - Tony: it\u2019s just a bit setting. So at the end of the full test it would be possible to just cycle shunted RC tests for all modules\n - Dennis: does it show up quickly enough for that? Or do you need to wait for longer?\n - Tony: yes\n - Ian: just turn on the shunts and wait for the temperature to stabilize before running the RC test\n - Dennis: yes, but then we want to wait for temperature to stabilise before testing\n - Ian: its just 1-2 min waiting after turning the shunts on\n- Gerrit: should we worry about putting heat load in there when cold?\n - Dennis: if we find this with metrology, we can also implement a shunt ramping\n - Tony: reason for shunting is to get headroom for cold noise. If we don\u2019t do this we don\u2019t get the overhead information\n### End-cap module metrology comparison\nSlide 6\n- Ingo: how can you be sure that your z measurement is very precise, when you x-y measurements are less accurate\n - Ewan: I think the z-measurement is more accurate because of the measurement method\n - William: Keyence is optimised for measuring heights, so z measurement is more precise\n - Ingo: you see the squares with different yellow tones. Maybe it would be interesting to do a more detailed measurement to see how well the z measurements are\n - William: have a few plots like that later in the talk\n - Ewan: haven\u2019t done that\n- Tony: you say that you can\u2019f measure the fiducials because of shadowing. Do you have a specification of the device about minimum measurement areas for z-measurements?\n - Ewan: as far as I am aware, we don\u2019t have this information from Keyence\n - William: we have tried to reverse-engineer this, but we couldn\u2019t find the information\n - Link in chat: https://www.keyence.com/products/microscope/macroscope/vr-3000/models/vr-3200/\n - William: the other question is how higher objects next to this affect the measurements\n- Tony: but then you won\u2019t know your bias between sensor and hybrid surfaces\n - William: should try to avoid getting as close as possible to the edge, but can add more points\nSlide 6\n- Carles: we measured the hybrid thickness and compensated for this.\n - Carles: point that is negative in plot should be zero, because there is just zero glue height at that point\n - Ewan: yes, making sure you don\u2019t have negative glue heights makes sense, good cross-check, used metrology values from module metrology document\n- Tony: did you get clarity on the missing measurements?\n - Carles: we are working on this, but we don\u2019t have the module back. For the missing points, it might be because the algorithm couldn\u2019t find the fiducials and didn\u2019t perform the measurement\n- Carles: slide 8: unlikely that that is the explanation - use a different way to measure this\n - Ewan: you do pattern recognition of the whole fiducial surface and then take an average of all points?\n - Tony: most people who use pattern recognition find one point of the pattern and then find that point consistently and use a measurement point relative to that\n - Tony: what you see is a tilt, consistently, and you don\u2019t get that from measuring on the brown area vs gold\n - Tony: difference of up to 20 microns between the two sites\n - Ewan: can see a bit of a tilt\n - Tony: they are identical and in the order of 20-50um\n - Tony: there is something else going on, might be a reference plane issue, looks very much tilted\n - Tony: comparison shows that one system sees it as tilted, the other one doesn\u2019t see it as tilted, and would be good to find out which one it is\n - William: there is something going on in the 10-20um level and we can try to figure out what is going on\n - Tony: have comparison from other end-cap sites and they are a lot more comparable\n - William: but none of them have used the Keyence\n - Tony: it could be the Keyence, or something else\n- Ewan: what is IFIC using?\n - Carles: an optical system\n - Tony: it is home made?\n - Carles: custom setup with commercial parts. We do triple cross checks with other systems to validate it\n - Tony: could try to swap with another group and see how it compares, DESy-HH and Prague and SFU-TRIUMF, and they agreed sub-5-micron, so could try to swap with one of them\n- Carles: would anyone be willing to measure this poor R0 module with their setup\n - Ingo: could do it here\n - Peter: don\u2019t do R0, but could try to set it up\n - William: need to look into what we want to achieve. The machine can do measurements within 5um, but 20um is already good enough for modules\n- Slide 11: Sven should be the same, made in the same process\n - William: yes, but they\u2019re different for the two hybrids on the same module\n - Peter: could be an effect of the tilt correction, depends on how you set up the coordinate system\n - Tony: if its just a coordinate system difference, then there would be a sign difference\n - Ewan: so it\u2019s not necessarily the same issue\n- Luise: you are not using the highest level of magnification for your measurement?\n - William: yes, using the medium magnification allows us to speed up the scanning process. We can try to do highest magnification and see if that changes anything.\n - William: are we really worried that the glue under the hybrid can be a performance issue. Also with cold noise\n - Luise: we still want good metrology results.\n - William: but there is good and great. The calibration blocks are measured to within specification\n### AOB\n- Moved institute updates: Adelaide and LBNL on February 28th",
