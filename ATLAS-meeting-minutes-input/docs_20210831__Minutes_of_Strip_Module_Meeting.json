->\n- HV tab sheets should have a ATLAS SN\n - Batch number encoded\n - A sequential serial number for the sheets\n - This is then merged into the HV-tab sheet serial number\n - Missing: YY identifier for HV-Tab sheets\n### [moved to next module meet after ITk week] Module Assembly: early vacuum removal follow up\n- \n### AOB\n- Ran out of time\n- All minutes now visible at:\u000bStrip Module Meeting Minutes",
