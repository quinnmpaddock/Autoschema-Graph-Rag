Risk of loosing expertise during those 6 months?\n - Break extended to this long duration due to delays (used to be ~3 months)\n - Might be that building last pre-production parts extends into this break\n- Priming factor for ABCs is mainly getting SEE tests done\n- When do 4 staves for integration tests have to be available at CERN?\n - Modules build up until July 21, loading after that, delivery to CERN ~end of July\n- Is it envisions that the remainder of pre-production (12 staves) can be smeared out in the time until production?\n - Potentially yes. But system tests items have to be ready in time for the system test FDR\n - After that no hard schedule reason to push through the remaining staves fast\n### Suction cups (Jane)\n- Current suction cups are sittings on modules without problems seen, not huge sample size but it\u2019s what we have\n - Modules handled with silicon suction cups have been irradiated and tested but not in huge numbers\n - A full test of sensors with residue is a massive undertaking\n- Cups not being anti-static should not be an issue (have never seen one)\n- Should be followed up offline\n - Craig has contacted company to understand process by which suction cups are made anti-static\n- Would it be possible to irradiate test piece with a lot of visible residue?\n - Technically yes but would involve significant amount of work\n - If we want to do this we need to find manpower\n### Cicorel cards (Simon)\n- Gerrit got much cheaper prices than UK, where does difference come from?\n - Could be due to limited availability \n- Should not be limited availability since they usually come with the bonders they sell for testing, maybe there\u2019s a new design now?\n - Not that Simon knows about, should check\n- Gerrit waits for response from Hesse US \n- Rectangular design preferred? Not clear\n- Should ensure that cards we get are actually optimised for pull testing, not for setting up bonder programs\n- Do we want to make a bulk purchase? \u2192 wait for US quote first\n### AoB\n- 130 barrel paper was accepted WITHOUT COMMENTS!!! Party time!\n## Actions\n1.",
