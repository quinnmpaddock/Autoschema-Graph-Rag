Concerned about EC hybrids.\n - Luise: Slide 7 is most concerning\n - Ashley: which delays are you changing?\n- Tony (glue study): SE4445 bounce also changes with less hardener and it start to fail a low hardener values. True blue looks great\n - Luise: agrees it looks slightly better\n- Luise shows delay settings\n - Ashley: could you please email them so I can have a look at this\n - Luise: yes\nNext week: \n### Proposal for future pull tests\nSlide 4\n- Bart: never have seen any parameter drift in Forest pull tests. Makes me question the idea of testing the same substrate every month\n - Luise: this test is not to catch parameter drift, it is more to find if there are issues with you wire-bonding machine\nSlide 6:\n- Forest: rotating hybrids around?\n - Luise: no, doing different surfaces every month\n - Forest: it sounds fine\n - Sven: these are not failed hybrids, they are just a surplus to our PPB needs\n - Luise: and the plan is to use the ASIC lands, so that they could be used\n- Sam: pull tests on hybrid tabs with bonded ASICs is not good\n - Sven: plan was to sacrifice hybrids for pull tests since the rate for this is low enough to not affect the quantity of available circuits\n### Module metrology descoping\nSlide 19\n- Andy: might be worth separating PPA and PPB\n- Luise: have already send some comments about secondary effects that should be correlated, e.g. from failed modules\n- Luise: it also might be different for you because you dispense on the sensor?\n - Tony: we put on sensor, BNL on hybrid backside and LBNL now useless a stencil\n - Luise: it might be different depending on the method; would like to see the correlation and also need to think about this a bit more\n - Tony: database and correlation is takes a while\n - Luise: would also be interesting to see the data where there were vacuum failures\n - Tony: the vacuum being off the HCC happens everytime. Need to wait for the new tools where this might be fixed. There wasn\u2019t a vacuum failure as such.\n- Andy: in terms of high voltage: need to distinguish between humidity problems and glue problems\n - Agree with Tony: look at failures and then see where it shows up\n - E.g. if you try to compare low glue heights with noise: all of the glue heights are low\n- Sven: worried about changing X requirement to +/- 300, there isn\u2019t really a requirement for this, the largest displacement is 150 um shown here, and combined with a +/- 200 um displacement of ASICs allowed on hybrids, you can have a total displacement of 500 um, and we need to look at bondability in these cases\n - Tony: Can dig it out: there was a rotation on a module, have seen something that bad and it was bondable\n - Tony: powerboard has the same problem, right? Sven: no, because you don\u2019t have this density of bond wires\n - Tony: cut on P2? Sven: P2 is problematic, P1 is much better controlled\n - Flex: keep in mind: there is also flex shrinkage\n - Tony: if you use 150, 200 or 300, you just remove hybrids\n - Andy: should we check the failed ones and see if they look okay?\n - Luise: might be good to look at the tail points by how much the ASICs are misplaced\n - Tony: if we have misalignment, believe it\u2019s usually the tools not aligned, i.e. an offset, or the hole is not centered perfectly (hole has tolerance), if you use the same holes, have no way of seeing ASIC position on module metrology\n - Sven: not entirely true: position of hole wrt fiducials is well controlled and under control (measured in flex QC)\n - Sven: problems can come in if you use different jigs for hybrid assembly and module assembly\n - Tony: worth having a discussion, did have hybrids with displacement, were bondable\n - Tony: from data we need to re-think cut strategy and maybe have different cuts for different points.\n- Tony: would you be upset with widening P1 a bit and widening P2 more?\n - Sven: makes sense to have stricter cut on P1 than P2\n - Would be interesting to look at end-cap data as well\n- Theo: Slide 30, this should already be in the spec that there is no limit on the low height. It\u2019s in the module metrology document\n - Tony: didn\u2019t see this, could you please provide this\n - Luise opened the document: spec is still 80 to 160, but exceptions can be made for lower glue heights, if there is no glue seepage\n - Theo: if this is automated, how does the user gets informed for this?\n - Luise: pass with problems, which then requires you to do a visual inspection\n - William: but in hybrids they are all failed\n - Andy: if the majority of parts fail, then the targets are too restrictive and need to be changed\n - Luise: need to wait for the new tools to see if that improves this\n - Tony: the HCC and the points will still be a problem\n - Tony: if we do metrology on these points, we need to have look at the points\n- Luise: we can descope during production e.g. for tools since they have changed\n - Theo: if you make progress towards production, we need to look at failed tests and reduce the number of fails. Pass with problem would be better\n- Luise: have seen breakdowns and need to see if there is a correlation\n - Tony: if the spec is breakdown, then we need a cut on that\n - Luise: but then why do we need metrology, if we only look at breakdown\n - Tony: heights are more important for temperature and electrical performance. And also don\u2019t want to include screw-ups\n - Luise: all agree that we only want to fail parts that are really failed\n - Andy: if you see a thin coverage and glue spill, then you see this\n - Tony: if you have a concern that a thin glue layer might result in a breakdown later in life because of glue on guard ring\n - Craig: haven\u2019t we had this discussion. We already agree to have this low limit in the metrology document when glue height is lower. So we can use \u201cPass with problems\u201d for that\n- Ian: can make all of this as complicated as we want, additional/secondary cuts can be included in the evaluation on different points, so as long as this can be handled through code, we\u2019re fine\n - Theo: older version of software is also an issue since cuts have been updated\n - Andy: not aware of any hybrid on any module that wasn\u2019t bondable\n - Luise: Cambridge has observed some bonding issues.\n - Bart: doesn\u2019t have anything to do with metrology\n - Andy: assumed it was not an issue with metrology, since it was on ABCs\n - Bart: it wasn\u2019t a failure related to metrology since neighbouring bonds worked (even with worse angles)\n- Theo: batch flex thicknesses: expected to change in the future\n - Tony: answer won\u2019t impact the package thickness, only the glue thickness\n - Theo: do we need to include this in the glue thickness calculation\n - Tony: should only widen the hybrid glue thickness distribution, need to track actual thicknesses, we may be subtracting the wrong number, but the outcome may be the same\n- Luise: schedule a dedicated meeting\n - Tony and Andy: sounds good\n - Tony: can we use hybrid position of +/- 150 um to decide what a tail is\n - Luise: yes, sounds good\n### Hybrid metrology descoping\n- Postponed to January 10th\n### AOB",
