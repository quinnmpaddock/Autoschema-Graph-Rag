Is there any other experience with the guns/fan-type ion blowers?\n - Xavi: we use the ion blower, don\u2019t have the gun\n - Jiri: I would say that this depends on the sensor and the problem it is experiencing. Often, 30 seconds can fix things, but more time is likely better.\n - Xavi: more time can be better\n - Carles: We have done this a lot without problems right?\n - Jiri: can only apply it for 1-2 sensors at a time, therefore don\u2019t use it much\n - Carles: I am asking if you specifically have applied the gun for longer than 30 seconds without issue.\n - Jiri: never saw any issues by applying for longer\n - Carles: Okay\n - John: Our ion gun and probe station are in different cleanrooms, so our tests haven\u2019t been systematic. But what we have done is check the static charge measurement that has built up on the sensor seconds after using the gun. The values are close to zero. Have been blowing for 10 minutes and haven\u2019t seen any degradation\n- William: I see a lot of sensors sitting on tables for minutes. I\u2019m not sure how we do this systematically. Is this a 1% or 10% effect? This could be very time consuming. \n - Xavi: The percentage is dependent upon things like shipping, so this is difficult to say. You can use it when you see issues. \n - William: Taking off covers and foam isn\u2019t really \u201cno con\u201d and perhaps it\u2019s better to wait.\n - Xavi: Waiting helps, but it may not be enough to recover in so many cases.\n - William: And it can\u2019t come back on a stave/petal?\n - Luise: We were experiencing nearly 10-15% of failure (in some batches), so we have found this to be very helpful.\n- Bart: In our sensor QC, we run _all_ of our sensors through ten minutes of deionization.\n - Use a little carousel where all the sensors are exposed together\n - Another comment. Early batches had a little static, which we saw on the strip tests. So we performed deionization and strip tests with a delay. We found that after 5-6 weeks, they were completely recovered.\n- Vitaliy: I think it is very useful to distinguish between two different scenarios. One is recovery, which is a bit time consuming. Another scenario is preventative. It\u2019s not fixing a problem, but reducing static charge rather. The tools shown by Xavi \u201cpromise\u201d that the static charge will be removed in seconds. This will avoid issues caused by users, so it makes sense that everyone uses them.\n- Luise: Regarding the sheets, we know the new ones are better than the old ones. Is it possible to get some boxes of the new sheets on sensors so we can test them? Can we get the part number and order some?\n - Xavi: I don\u2019t think we have a reference for these sheets, but we should ask the sensor ACs.\n - Vitaliy: The old and new sheets have the same part number, so this is difficult.\n - Luise: Could we just ask Hammatsu to send them to us?\n - Vitaliy: It\u2019s the same for them.\n - Luise: Can we just ask them to send us two boxes of sheets without any sensors, would this be possible?\n - Vitaliy: We can ask, but it\u2019s not a \u201ccontrolled deviation\u201d. No one picks these out on purpose.\n - Bart: When I deionize the sensors, I deionize the sheets as well. The sheets themselves don\u2019t generate static.\n - Vitaliy: Did you do a rubbing test on them afterwards?\n - Bart: Yes\n - Vitaliy: Interesting\n - Bart: And this persists for several weeks.\n - Bart: HPK says they improved them, so it may be a process change, not a material change\n - Vitaliy: The issue is believed to occur during shipment. (microphone degrading)\nGroup update: IHEP + RAL\n- Luise: You said you are limited by the TC setups. Do you know how much more capacity you would need to keep up?\n - Navid: We would need at least one more box.\n - Luise: Is that possible, could you get another?\n - Navid: I\u2019m not sure, it might be.\n - Bart: It\u2019s not very possible.\nAMAC on modules: Calibration & Monitoring\n- Vitaliy: Do you have an idea of when we might have all of this working \u201cout of the box\u201d?\n - Miao: with Bruce on leave, things are on hold, but already discussing implementation and hope to get it to work out of the box in January\n - Vitaliy: It sounds like the remaining steps involve integration?\n - Miao: I will be implementing them. There has been a lot of change since I began this, so I need to discuss with Bruce how to implement this in the latest code.\n - Vitaliy: I understand you are the main developer and that you can\u2019t clash with Bruce\u2019s implementation of things. Thanks, I think I understand this better now. \n - Miao: shouldn\u2019t disrupt anything, just need to find the right place\n- Paul: Do I understand that you are not using the zero calibration method to get the zeros?\n - Miao: do you mean for each channel?\n - Paul: For each channel\n - Miao: after calibrating each channel individual, there is also the offset calibration\n - Paul: Okay, so you are doing that.\n- William: (Slide 15) When you turn the DCDC on, you\u2019re doing some measurements there? This whole 1V drop seems to depend on the \u2018fluttering\u2019 of the DCDC in the plot above. \n - Miao: spikes are probably not real. They occur during the tests [this is seen in TC as well]. The 1V drop _is_ real however.\n - William: hadn\u2019t realized it was only on one powerboard - see this sometimes on some modules, might be interesting to understand why some have this and some don\u2019t\n - Miao: We will keep investigating the weird spikes.\n- Luise: There are several parts to what you are doing. You are performing these PB tests to make a module config file? Is that correct?\n - Miao: Currently, we just have the part that we pull from the powerboard tests\n - Cole: intention would be to use this with autoconfig\n- Luise: So the idea is to use the PB test to compare the same functions on the module?\n - Miao: This is an alternative. We can still do it the previous way, which is more accurate (?). This will be used when it is difficult to tune the values while on a module/PB. \nQT report: Thermal Cycling\n- No Questions\nIssues After Ion Blowing at IFIC\n- Xavi: I did not see these effects when using the blower. It would be good to increase the statistics on this. I\u2019m wondering if you could apply the blower to the bottom of the sensors, but changing factors such as the distance and time. \n - Carles: yes, can repeat, can apply to the other segment and expose for a longer time and see if it can be reproduced\n - Xavi: Sounds good. It shouldn\u2019t be destructive.\n- Vitaliy: Just a couple of questions. I didn\u2019t completely get it. What is the \u201ctop stream\u201d.\n - Carles: Answered it [stream covered by hybrid]\n - Vitaliy: Okay, thanks\n - Vitaliy: Does the ion blower require dry air?\n - Carles: use it for ion blowers\n - Vitaliy: It might be useful to see how well it works on another object. You can use the static meter to see if this is causing static charge-up as a useful sanity check. \n- Vitaliy: do you have UV curing bars for hybrid UV glue curing?\n - Carles: old ones, yes\n - Vitaliy: They do provide UV light, so this might be useful. I believe Prague did this as a first test before the current UV setups.\n- Cole: Is the current different afterwards?\n - Carles: It\u2019s the same\n- Luise: It looks like (on slide 6), that part of the sensor is not as affected. Do you believe this is because the sensor was \u201cprotected\u201d from the ion blower?\n - Carles: I don\u2019t see how they are as protected by the PB, but it\u2019s possible.\n - Luise: It would be good to try and apply the ion gun to that region to see if you can make it behave like the rest of the sensor. It would be good to see if this is something special here.\n- Vitaliy: when you did electric cold tests, what was the bias voltage?\n - Carles: For the first time, it was -350V. Then it was below, around 280V (maybe 300V in some cases).\n - Carles: CAEN can\u2019t go too high\n - Vitaliy: Sounds good.\nQT report: database reporting\n- Luise: I am having trouble finding the pages you are showing from the links you are sharing. \n - Shudong: Yeah, the webpages are local, so you are not currently able to access them.\n - Luise: It would be great to merge this into Kenny\u2019s reporting repo. \n - Luise: Is there a function to show this per cluster as opposed to per institute?\n - Shudong: Currently, you have to select all sites for the cluster individually\n - Luise: If you look at the top left corner (slide 9), you mention \u201cper cluster\u201d, it would be great if we can use that.\n- Pavol: Can you choose by batch?\n - Shudong: For PPA/PPB, I did not implement this, as there was no flag to indicate this.\n - Pavol: There are batches in the DB\n - Luise: Yes, you can look this up in the DB\n - Pavol: But perhaps this wasn\u2019t a part of your QT \u2026\nDiscussion: adding stiffeners to modules\nPropose to discuss at HV BD TF meeting on Friday\nAOB\nNone",
