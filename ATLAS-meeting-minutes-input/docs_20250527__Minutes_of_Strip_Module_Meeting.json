It would probably be better to do it in grafana. Probably a good idea to put it in mattermost. Also for the IV scan we could add this, it wasnt there because it wasnt as stable but it should be easy to add it \n### Pinholes from Bonding Errors at the end of Lifetime\n- Gerrit: Re-bonding is a bad idea, reduces throughput. 8 channels that have a problem just go out. As I understand it in the experiment when the barrel is operational you wont bother with low efficiency strips you will just turn it off. Analysis with low efficiency strips would be a nightmare. At BNL we do not rewire front ends, we have tried this and we do not do this anymore.\n - Emily: that would solve the problem.\n- Vitaly: This will be found out and you can mask the chanel, in principle it can work either way, the tricky point will be finding them before end of life. Unless you do a dedicated test you won't know. It would be more clear to not re-bond. More importantly the wirebonders would be more sensitised. I have preference for not re-bonding\n- Vialiy: the damage happens when there are no wire, it hides the problem\n- Vitaly: it won't affect the yield\n- Conclusion: do not wirebond channels where the bonder lost the wire and hit the sensor pad without wire. \n### AOB\n- Request to the module ACs to get the grading system in place soon",
