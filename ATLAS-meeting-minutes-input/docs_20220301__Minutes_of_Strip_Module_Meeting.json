Prefere with sound.\nProject news\n- William: after parts have been made for staves/petals or after staves/petals have been assembled/populated\n - Luise: after you have build your share of the staves/petalls\n### Task tracker items\nUpdates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda\nAnd also task tracker for updates\n- 01/03/2022: Barrel tasks\n- 07-11/03/2022 ITk week\n- 15/03/2022: EC tasks\n- 22/03/2022: Barrel tasks\n- Shipping readiness (incl import procedure)\nAustralia now has solutions in place to ship modules to Europe\n- Hybrid crate setup, finalisation and roll-out\nClose this one and use the new one\n- Single Hybrid Testing Database Implementation\nMentioned in introduction\n- Hybrid Burn In Software\nStill some software issues to be debugged\n- Single Module Test Database Implementation\nCurrent plan: upload test data to individual hybrids, use \u201con module\u201d stage for module test data, but upload to individual hybrids\n- Multi Module Test\nFirst end-cap cold box arrived in Zeuthen\nWarwick QT student now working on open questions, specifically for ITSDAQ questions\n- PPB Module for April Irradiation\nCovered in intro\n### 2-part epoxy dispensing at SCIPP\n- No comments/questions\n### End-cap test results\n- Carles: already saw issue with ground screw (reported in the past) and reported to EC cold box group\n - Luise: should probably be updated in module test document\n - Carles: I don\u2019t know the final outcome. DESYH investigated further\n - Ashley: has send some comments by email\u000bWhat is the expected noise?\n - Dennis: like SS module ~800-900\n - Ashley: would look at jig that you are grounded properly (also look at HV-filter network on test frame)\n - Ashley: also have reservations about the connection from frame to jig\n- William: do you have the sense line ground bonds?\n - Luise: no\n - Dennis: usually does not recommend sense for LV, there is no real benefit for single modules\n - William: was talking about the field shaping bonds\n - Luise: they are there\n - Ashley: if you just pub bare hybrid on test jig you will not learn anything since they are not sensitive; what surface is the test jig on?\n - Luise: ESD safe foam\n - Vitaly: could also try to probe the LV on the hybrid\n - Dennis could probe on shieldbox for GND and on large pad for LV\n - Ashley shows plot of noise: it is elevated everywhere equally which indicates common mode coming in from some source (e.g. the jig)\n### Liverpool GUI - ASIC Assembly\n- William: how long does it take once you push \u201cgo\u201d\n - Sven: about 10-20 seconds\n - William: sometimes get timeouts, then have to fill by hand\n - Sven: are you using ITK DB?\n - JJ: yes\n### bPol V6 planning\n- Sven: wouldn\u2019t do more thinflex hybrids with PPB parts: not good for building modules\n - Forest: tighter gap for curing, probably cured fine but gap is not held at correct height\n - Tony: not sure if Liverpool wants to build SS modules with their thinflex hybrids\u000bWould be interesting to see a LS module build with v4 powerboard at Liverpool and compare to US\n - Ashley: Y hybrids will always be a close run, should maximize use of X hybrids (build LS module)\n - Tony: need to use V6 in same way and need to check before PPB\u000bMake a v4 and v6 pair at each site\u000bWhat to do after that and with those\n - Luise: there is a new batch of v6 that is more reliable and one should be used for the test beam\n - Tony: need one or two from Timons hand-stuffed batch\n - Luise: LS vs SS: last 2 staves from pre-production would be LS (and most likely to be dropped), so using LS sensors should not be a problem\n - Tony: even for SS should be fine since we ordered for a more extended pre-production\n - Tony: would be nice to make 1 more v4 module, and then go for v6\u000bIf to use the hand-stuffed v6 and put on PPB stave for systems test, they could fail so need to be careful; but would be good to put on a one-off stave\n - Dennis: one of the test as part of systems test is transient test and requires a stave with v6 modules\n - Tony: original systems test was v4 only\n - Dennis: but afterwards there will be v6\n - Tony:pre-production order for powerboards are all v4\n - Dennis: thought the second half of PPB was v6\n - Tony: no, only 100 powerboards ordered\n - Luise: should we build the v6 modules at SCIPP/Liverpool and then see on how to continue from there\n - Tony: Timon needs to know how many are required to hand-replace v4 to v6\u000bLonger term would need to make enough parts for AMACStar development, but would need to understand where they go first\n - Ashley: is the coil orientation different between v4 and v6?\n - Tony: no, they are same. And they will be same in production\n - Ashely: for the time being suggest to go with v6 since they are used in production\u000bMaybe build another LS type module\n- Sven: for a one-off, could use a thinflex hybrid, just becomes tedious for more than 1\n - Tony: how about Liverpool uses thinflex for one V4 thin flex module for comparison with SCIPP\n- Plan: Liverpool makes one thin-flex + bPolV4 module for comparison with SCIPP\n- Then: build v6 modules in both places for comparison\n- Then, afterwards, decide based on results if more sensors will be needed\n- Tony: sensor group would prefer to use production sensors for this if possible\n - US: use production sensors\n - UK/China: use pre-production sensors\n - Bart: would it be worth waiting for the new batch of sensors?\n - Vitaliy: only expected to ship mid April, probably too late\n- Check with systems test people if mixed modules should be made for systems tests!\n- Check with US people needs to set up IVs through AMAC, how many AMACstar modules are needed for that\n### PPB Thinfex Module at SCIPP\n- Dennis: can you try the sensor current and hybrid NTC readout with this?\n - Jacob: haven\u2019t tested it so far with this setup\n - Tony: is there any routine for the test?\n - Dennis: it\u2019s the same syntax, just a slightly different name\u000bShould be in working branch\n - Tony: don\u2019t have the right configuration for ABCStar so far, waiting for shipment in database\n - Do we need the configuration for AMACStar?\n - Dennis: when using an FMC-DP, required functionalities are already there and available\n - Dennis: for AMAC, planning to make [can we write that in notes] code improvements where e.g. restart is no longer required, need to understand how much database interaction is \n- Tony: we want to also include unbonded test in IV, for which you need the AMAC\n - Luise: let\u2019s wait until the functions are there, first develop the unbonded test, then think about how to combine them later\n- Dennis: Did you just run the full test or GUI tests as well?\n - Jacob: only full test\n - Dennis: might be good to run the GUI as well since they are in physics mode.\n - Tony: still surprised by looking at bands and how much they are separated\n - Dennis: it\u2019s interesting how much lower it is, give that it\u2019s the same ASIC\n - Tony: don\u2019t have the right configuration, but don\u2019t expect that to make that much of a difference\n - Ash: if the coil orientation is wrong, field coupling into sensor backside could cause this issue\n - Tony: could explain it, need to get the correct ASIC configurations to do the final test\n - Could explain why the very first module was looking so good - maybe that one accidentally had the correct coil orientation\n - Ash: checked with magnetic probe, indeed looked like the coil orientation could have caused it\n- Tony: know that the hand-stuffed ones have the coil in the right orientation, know for sure for those\n - Problem: now changing substrate, AMAC etc at once, so mixing different results\n - Would be good to get magnetic triggering results from those modules to compare to coil orientation\n#### AOB\n- ITk Week next week!",
