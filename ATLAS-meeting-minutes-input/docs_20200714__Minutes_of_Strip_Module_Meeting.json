When would that be reviewed?\n - All models have gone through EDMS review before, 2D drawings should be started right away (aka now)\n - If no significant comments are made for 3D drawings, kick off 2D drawing review immediately after 3D review is finished\n - Give another week then for the review of the 2D drawings \n- To sum up: after Marc has uploaded version of drawings we want to go with:\n - One week to review 3D drawings (review completion targeting 24th July)\n - Start 2D drawings in parallel\n - Start 2D drawing review as soon ad 3D review is done\n - Finish that review after a week (review completion targeting 31st July, 7th August may be more realistic)\n - WILL NEED QUICK RESPONSES ON EDMS - THE MORE CRAIG/INGO HAVE TO CHASE, THE MORE DELAY THIS WILL INCUR!!!\n - Get first tools to all groups by mid-September (assuming 4-6 week production)\n - This still may be quite optimistic if we don\u2019t push quickly\n - Bushes to be investigated in parallel as backup solution\n - Discussion towards end of the year about whether to continue with preproduction tools through production\n - Rework or new tools with bushings or keep as is to be discussed\n### Practical EC tooling review (Carles & Pablo)\n- Timeline less optimistic compared to Craig\u2019s \n- Company assumes tools could be done by November\n- Seems matching with Toronto\u2019s timeline where full tool production could take ~1-2 months according to first quotes\n- Zeuthen technician ran into the same problem, would prefer the 90 degree connectors as well\n - Preference because they use glue robot\n - DESY HH uses same robot and does not see any problems\n - Ingo therefore withdraws his comment\n - Will discuss offline to come to a final conclusion\n- Can this be modified easily in drawings?\n - Marc will need dimensions for this, but in principle it can be done\n - Will discuss offline\n - Will be changed for all tools\n- Why are straight ones preferable?\n - With 90 degree one the tube is getting pretty close to the hybrid/power board\n### AoB\n- Barrel transport boxes?\n - Did we decide to go into production? Yes, Hongbo has put out order (~40 days until delivery)\n- Will ping company for dummy hybrid order (EC) to see if we can get delivery update",
