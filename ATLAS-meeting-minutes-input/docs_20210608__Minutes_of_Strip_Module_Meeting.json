Dennis assumes delivery of active boards within a month\n- UK/China module thermal cycling setup\n - UK cold boxes have been delivered to module testing sites\n- US module thermal cycling setup\n - Have software for other institutes, are starting to test it\n - BNL has been doing thermal cycling since over a year, other two groups are starting now\n - In process of commissioning them now\n - Update in four weeks\n- EC hybrid test-panel finalisation\n - Have to increase the hole size on the panels a bit so they don\u2019t get stuck on the panel jigs\n - Could start EDMS review as soon as updated versions have been uploaded\n - This only concerns production panel, so should not start EDMS review before all changes have been implemented\n - Update in 3 weeks\n- Production of hybrid panel cover\n - Received shipment with missing parts\n - Cutting is going on, about 40% done\n - Can pick up partial orders to send out covers needed on shorter time scale\n - Will start adding inserts now, deliver first covers to Toronto by end of next week\n - Update in two weeks\n- Production of stencils\n - PB stencils got deleted and have now a separate entry\n - Craig kicked off review\n - Should finish soon\n - Hybrid stencils got approved on EDMS, production is ongoing\n- Production of module frame cover\n - Received all frame covers\n - Karo is preparing list how many covers should go where\n - If anybody needs some urgently let Christian know\n - Update in two weeks\nAll sites please purchase all the required Nexys and Genesys G2 boards NOW! (global shortage of Si parts makes unavailability, in the near future, likely - see e.g. the MicroZed board (current delivery time: 52 weeks))\n### AMAC current measurement & referencing caps\n- From 1.8k start seeing ADC sampling noise (there is an issue in the slides)\n- Standard deviation is consistent when taking corrections into account\n- Peter doesn\u2019t believe that C17 is between Opamp and ground\n - Peter has no objection to remove hybrid capacitors\n - But needs another capacitor between HV-ret and ground\n- Karol: 2 capacitors on powerboard \n - Removing C12 accidentally helped a bit\n - C17 to HV-ref (inputs of Opamp?????)\n- Dave: main recommendation is to remove the hybrid caps\n - Peter: still 10 counts of noise\n- For PPB barrel powerboard release need to wait for endcap powerboard results because of slightly different capacitor use\n - Peter: HV-ref and HV-ret should both be coupled to ground plane via a capacitor individually; this is implemented in endcap powerboard, but not barrel\n- Need to know if hybrid BOM change is required\n - On what timeframe?\n - Removing the capacitors could potentially require a ECR\n - Ashley: also need to consider the 2 capacitors from the cold noise issue\n- Change in EC hybrids would only delay shipment by a day or so\n - Fine to do for Prototyping and PPA parts\nDecision: agreed that hybrid capacitors can be removed (keeping the pads) - ECR to be prepared, Dave to sketch first draft\nDave to follow up documentation on powerboard capacitors.\n### ASIC counting update\n- Craig: 268 HCC at RAL almost covers EC PPA as well\n - Count Craig did \u2026 missed due to bg noise\n### R0 Metrology\n- Try to do a test with dummy powerboards to see if powerboard tools work\n- Ingo: Optically measuring holes is difficult and sometimes not reliable\n - Cross-reference with touch probe showed better results, but not feasible to do for all tools\n- William: not doing pin distance measurement, but test all tools fit\n### [move to next week] Hybrid Package Height\n- \n### AOB\n- none",
