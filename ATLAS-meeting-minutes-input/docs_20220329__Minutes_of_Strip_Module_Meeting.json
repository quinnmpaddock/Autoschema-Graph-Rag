Trying to make more crates.\nFinalisation of panels for EC hybrid testing\nR5 frames being reproduced and are expected to be distributed in time for PPB\nProduction of test frames\nHave 20 of each test frame unpopulated being populated, minor change compared to previous version: changed HV filter, moved LED positions, no routing changes, only population changes\nCan only be distinguished by looking at resistor\nProduction of stencils for the EC \nNew frames made and sent to Freiburg, waiting for feedback\nCraig: PB/hyb availability \nUli: speed up can't comment but going faster than predicted\nPowerboards: issue are missing shieldboxes, fast tracking an order of shield boxes, consider making shield boxes in house to speed things up\nCraig: estimate for when powerboards can be sent out?\nDennis: first ones expected back in roughly eight weeks (end of May), difficult to estimate in-house powerboard QC\nCraig: can this be sped up?\nDennis: can\u2019t say before first batch has come back\nCarles: first batch will only cover PPB1 ?\nDennis: should cover most of PPB (QC on the received PB can be first made only for PPB1 PBs)\n### Institute Contributions\nDESY-Z/HU\n- William: do you have the pi from Lund?\n - Ingo: they don\u2019t send the pi, they send the board, so go ahead and order a pi already\n- Carles: what are you planning to do about the problem with the pickup tool?\n - Ingo: chiseled away the pin\n - Recommendation from Freiburg: file off/remove/cut off the pin\n - Carles: also observed on R0 prototype hybrids from Toronto\nBirmingham\n- Luise: could you maybe test at different low bias voltages to distinguish between bonded and unbonded channels\n - Laura and Phil: at which voltages?\n - Luise: 5, 10, 15 and 20 V\n- Ingo: didn\u2019t we also want to look into the burst scan?\n - Luise: yes, can be done with the root files, so please ensure to provide the root files as well as the result files\n- Vitaliy: don\u2019t understand the plot - what is shown there?\n - Phil: yes, here we\u2019re testing whether the recorded bad/unconnected wire connections are correct and match the tested dead channels\n - Vitaliy: blue curve is not test data?\n - Phil and Laura: blue curve is known bad channels from wire bonding records showing bonds known to have failed\nMontreal\n- Carles: for the end-of user statement from Melbourne: are you in touch with them, do you need help from production management?\n - JF, yes, in touch with them\nNext week: IHEP, Dortmund, IFIC\n### GUI for hybrid tests\n- William: looks great! Question 1: we always do an output delay scan before running tests, you don\u2019t seem to do that\n - Christian: not enough of an expert\n - Dennis: not sure\n - Christian: send me an e-mail and we\u2019ll see if it can easily be implemented\n- William: does this use \u201cfull test\u201d or individual tests?\n - Christian: creates C++ macros, try to use the same ones as in pull-down menus\n - Craig: is there a full test option?\n - Christian: yes, can just run full test\n- Bruce: in general, most of these things should be embedded in ITSDAQ where possible, having a front-end is useful, but it shouldn\u2019t do anything with individual tests - people should always only run the full test in ITSDAQ\n - Christian: it is running the test in ITSDAQ\n - Bruce: production procedure is to just run the full test, shouldn\u2019t modify what the full test list should be in another GUI\n - Christian: when running the full test, GUI just calls FullTest in ITSDAQ\n - Dennis: very useful in the end-cap case, where different module types are in different places\n - Bruce: this could be looked up from the database: check fuse IDs, check hybrid/module types and then download config files\n - Dennis: difficult, because burn-in is the first GUI where hybrids can be mapped to hybrid types\n - Bruce: question for how ABCs are mapped to hybrids, which then becomes a more involved GUI\n - William: very useful for what Toronto needs to do (random combinations of hybrid tests)\n- Christian: very happy for input!\n- Luise: would be good to integrate two things in the configuration files\n - ABC probing results (from the database)\n-> requires DB interaction\n - Phase space parameters from ITSDAQ scans to determine right config parameters\n-> does not require DB interaction, local ITSDAQ interaction only\n- Luise: result analysis - would this be a summary of all results?\n - Christian: yes, need info on how to analyse these\n#### AOB\n- Any volunteers for magnetic field tests?",
