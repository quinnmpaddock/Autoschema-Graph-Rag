There are other issues that require cleaning, but if they get under control and only high peel becomes the decisive point about cleaning or not, we want to understand this and have a plan in place that might result in not having to clean the flexes.\n### ITSDAQ news\n- Andy: if we have the auto AMAC function, we should baseline automatic power supply control?\n - Cole: yes, everyone should try to get their power supplies controlled through ITSDAQ, and if it does not work please contact us.\n - William: does this include the LV supply?\n - Cole: the LV is far less important, but it is very useful if these values can be read through ITSDAQ. There is a lot of support for TTI supplies.\n - William: we have the same power supply for years, we don't\u2019 want to replace it\n - Peter: if it is controllable, please send me the make and model and I will look into this\n - Peter: there is one reason where it can become very important (module box), but not so essential for the hybrid burn in\n - William: we can get you the model number\n### Institute Contributions: \nDortmund:\n- William (slide 7): what is impact of angle to X-Y precision\n - Marta: in this example it\u2019s a good case, but if the module is displaced a lot, we can also see this\n - William: but even the -11deg rotation, a few degrees can be a lot of point offset. How precise are yout to find the fiducials after the rotation correction? We struggle with this part\n - Marta: we are still working on this\n - William: we have tried lots of automated processes, but failed and went back to do this manually for every module\n - William: and there are also imperfections on edges\nNext meeting: Oslo\n### Cycling to death at BNL\n- Tony: questions about the HV rises (slide 40) at high voltages are not normal. Current seems a bit low (left) while other looks more familiar (right)\n - Abe: right is more trusted in terms of calibration\n - Tony: losing the configuration, the current would still be the same. No idea about difference in jump.\n - Tony (to Peter): there are current jumps when warming or cooling. What settings could be lost in chip that could cause this?\n - Abe: could also be some re-configuration?\n - Tony: also looks like the trim settings were dropped\n - Stefania: looks like it, but if doing the test is seems to re-configure\n - Stefania: and this seems to happen multiple times\n - Abe: have also seen this once at a BNL module\n - Stefania: guess is that it has something to do with FMC-DP => discuss this offline with Peter\n - Stefania: the problems don\u2019t start at the beginning, but after a couple of cycles\n - Tony: BNL had some assembly issues (glue near guard ring) but we don\u2019t know what the effect over time would be\n- Vitaliy: Thank you, it's a lot of work for this study\n- Vitaliy: for BNL_10 there is glue on guard ring, which could explain the intermittent breakdowns and the noise edge channels.\n- Vitaliy (slide 24): are these noise channels also visible warm?\n - Abe: need to check this\n- Stefania: we will add metrology to the study when it becomes available (bow)\n### End-cap module metrology changes for PPB powerboards\nSlide \n- William: are we worried about the glue under the box?\n - Peter: there is not much in this area we can currently probe\n - Peter: there is another issue with the current setup of this powerboard (the tool) so we don\u2019t control the glue there\n - William: that is my concern, we might have to abandon the PB_4 measurement point\n - William: measuring on photoresist is not reliable\n- Sven: is there a possibility to add a feature for metrology later?\n - Dennis: difficult\n - William: if we don\u2019t have a pin there to control the thickness, maybe it\u2019s hard to do a measurement\n - Dennis: could maybe do something\n - Marc: would we not be sensitive from the shieldbox height?\n - Gerrit: no, because there is little control of the soldered height of the shieldbox\n - Gerrit: we can currently only reliably measure height on gold pads\n - William: that is my experience as well with measuring on solder resist\n - Dennis: can have a look to see if I can open up copper there \n - William: and if we can\u2019t put a pin there and the powerboard bends, that will also have an impact on the glue height\n### Hybrid Surface Pictures\nSlide \n- Tony: you didn\u2019t see this on all hybrids?\n - Forrest: 2238 was the worst, there were a couple of arrays with none, some where all had this\n - Forrest: maybe arrays after 2238 were better\n - Sandra: 2225 had most peel, for surface we only looked at the pad for ABC landing. \n - Tony: but 2225 had none\n - Sandra: 2225 is the first production batch, so maybe there were some learning steps after pre-production\n - Vitaliy: Sandra, are you taking pictures of arrays? \n - Sandra: yes, as part of QC we scan them and we also take some picture. We mainly looked at ABC landing\n - Vitaliy: so you can check this with the results from Forest?\n - Sandra: yes\n - Forest: used the bonder, because that is where I noticed the issue and if it shows up there, then this would be my criteria for go/no-go\n- Sven: if anyone (barrel or EC) sees issues with their flexes, it would be good to give feedback to their flex production site as soon as possible so that they can look into this\n### AOB\n- \u2014",
