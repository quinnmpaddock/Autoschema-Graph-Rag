Will respin R3 panels. Debugging is problematic due to marginal impedance control, works sometimes, sometimes not\u2026 \n - Other test panels? Single hybrids\n - Similar status. We are validating 13 hybrids, powerboards, \u2026 \n - Does not yet make sense to order prod quantities\n - If Freiburg knows of any working panel please let Dortmund know so they can go and produce (any, not fixed to R1)\n - What about panels for burn in crate?\n - Dennis can provide single panel with 1 hybrid\n - Also sensors will come back that Zeuthen loaned Fr\n - Sven: any estimate for how long it will take to figure this out?\n - Dennis: no\n- Production of the common jigs required in the EC\n - Sergio sent email with new design for test jig (now on EDMS), as only minor comments we hope to go and approved after module ACs checked it\n - Oskar is waiting for those final drawings before progressing\n- Production of R0 and R1 test frames\n - See above (EC hybrid test-panel finalisation), Fr working on validating current frames\n- Production of R2 test frames\n - See above (EC hybrid test-panel finalisation), Fr working on validating current frames\n - R2 is closer to being validated, will be the first to finish\n- Production of R3, R4 and R5 test frames\n - See above (EC hybrid test-panel finalisation), Fr working on validating current frames\n- Production of LED bars for the EC\n - Majority of work taken on by Tynan now\n - Tynan has sent Dennis a design for R4, is waiting for validation from Dennis before tackling the other ones\n - Dennis will have a look at R4 design and give Tynan feedback\n - Update in 2 weeks\n- Production of module frame cover for EC\n - Covers have not yet arrived, should arrive end of March\n - Update in 2 weeks\n- EC PPA/prototype powerboard order\n - First batch hand populated, bug in footprint for one diode, have to redo pick and place files to hot-fix this for exchange diode\n - Hope to have them done in 2 weeks\n### HV-Tab Cold Cycling Test\n- Petal is considering to add a spacer/fishing line under tab below sensor to add some free space to allow for compensate of CTE expansion/shrinkage\n - Maybe consider a wiggle instead\n - Module folks to get into contact with loading folks to figure out a way to add wriggle room for tab when bonding to core. E.g. fishing line spacer, but dedicated tool probably better\n - Talk shows that normal mounting might be sufficient, but want to look into how to make it more reliable\n- Will the tab be completely covered in glue or is there a void?\n - BNL: tab not covered in SE4445\n - Ingo: tab should not be covered with SE4445\n### Dummy powerboards for gluing tests\n- Printing bend powerboards for barrel sounds like a good idea\n - Also good to evaluate endcap tools\n- Resin printing in house\n - Freiburg: hybrids bend a lot in post-curing process; need to get parameters wright\n - Zeuthen will get online resin printing soon\n - Canada (who was that?) also has a small printer and would be happy to help\n- Vitaliy: are there metrology results as input to produce bend hybrids?\n - Karol: currently no plan to do any detailed metrology\n - Maybe use powerboard pick-up tool to measure it from the bottom to get shape\n### AOB\n- Vitaliy\n - Long term tests with hybrids and modules, specially for sensor humidity issues\n - Also long hybrid burn in\n - Would be very useful, also for module PRR\n - Use end of PPA or beginning of PPB parts to do this\n - For SQ DB interaction need to be ready, so having a dedicated module DB meet might be useful\n - Target to have this in 3 weeks\n- Luise\n - announcing that we will discuss weighing QC comments in the QA/QC meeting this Thursday\n- Sven\n - Please send recipient address for hybrid crate electronics to Ash\n - Email, Phone Nr, Shipping address, Name\n - One address for european deliveries please, then redistribute",
