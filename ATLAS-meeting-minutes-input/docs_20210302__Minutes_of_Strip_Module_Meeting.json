Is it too tight?\n - Sounds like we could to some degree boil this one down\n- Discussion about how EC can insert pins to the required precision\n - Barrel plans to use real powerboard\n - EC should prepare using a specially machined dummy PB counter or use 300um gauges. To be followed up offline.\n - Pins are a slip fit so can be adjusted once proper EC thicknesses are known\n- US plans to use hybrid jig for module gluing alignment\n - EC is mostly planning to pick up from panel, so precision is required there\n - Hybrid sites need to make sure they understand the pick-up process at all the module sites they are feeding and vice-versa\n### R1 tooling update\n- Current status of R1 tools shown, things of note for possible discussion/follow-up\n - Grooves not machined\n - QR codes rather than RFID\n- QR codes easier to use locally but RFID can be sent with tools if required\n - This is minimum requirement\n### Module in Database\n- Discussion about which sensors (as listed in the DB) to use for modules\n - ATLAS18\n - There should not be a mechanical type -> Sven will sort out with Vitaliy offline\n- Sven will add tests to different stages when they are properly implemented\n- How are test frames identified in the database? \u2192 RFID tags (on latest barrel frames)\n- Who takes the action to put the module frames into the DB?\n - Also brings up the question who can increment \u201ccycles used\u201d as currently only person who first entered them can change this\n - Potentially needs more thought/discussion from everyone\n### AOB\n- None",
