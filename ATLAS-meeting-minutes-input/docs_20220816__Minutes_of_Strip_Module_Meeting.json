Is there any control over it?\n - Ashley: believe it is set by the chip itself (MOSFET inside of chip)\n - Ash: might be something we can do, leave it with Ash - there may be something we can do about it\n### Task tracker items\nUpdates to tasks - see task tracker link in agenda\nAnd also task tracker for updates\n- 16/08/2022: EC\n- 23/08/2022: Barrel\n- 30/08/2022: EC\n- 06/09/2022: Barrel\n- R1 tool production\n - Geoffrey: contact Uppsala if you need your R1 tools, they are ready now\n - Luise: only if they want their first set replaced or if they want the full production quantity?\n - Geoffrey: should be full quantity, but please get in touch\n - Carles: do you need the tools that were first sent out back?\n - Geoffrey: needs to be discussed on an individual basis\n - Sven: please send an e-mail to the list\n- Endcap module thermal cycling setup\n - No news\n- Modules for Test Beam\n - TRIUMF: R2 module glued, to be bonded today\n - Cambridge: SS module is being assembled\n - Regarding other modules: \n - R1 was built, analysis ongoing,\n - R3 and R4: planned for end of November, need to pay attention to make sure they are assembled on time given powerboard re-design, sensors are irradiated and in hand, now waiting for powerboards\n- Glue Studies\n - Dedicated talk today\n - Waiting for polaris+ for the lab joint test, but started with other glues\n - Chemical analysis shows chlorine in all glue samples (5% in polaris, 2-3% in other glues)\n### Institute Contributions\n- \nNext week: \n### Update on glue studies: sensor tests\n- Vitaly: what is the thermal cycling?\n - Luise: we are going to do the same thermal cycling that we did for previous glues: -30 to +40 in same rate as before and also look at accelerated temperature change\n - Luise: do rapid changes to see if that causes stress, also stay at high temperature (40C) to look for longterm effects\n - Vitaliy: are you irradiating with gammas?\n - Luise: yes, only irradiate with gammas so no annealing\n - Vitaliy: do you measure strip capacitance, since this affects strip noise?\n - Jack: plot shows all the measurements we take\n - Vitlaliy: this is not the strip capacitance, it is the coupling capacitance. They have different effects on the noise\n - Jack: can figure out how to do this.",
