For strobe for example?\n - Strobe might not change, but FUSEids addition and SW tag / git info / FW version will require some additions\n - For 3pt gain needs per strip info added\n### HV tabbing and SQ requirements\n- Discussion about which parameters to aim for\n - 300g/500g seems a lot, is it really required?\n - Is better for module mounting, the higher this is\n- Do we need more sites to show that these parameters are achievable before we go for site quali with these target parameters?\n- Bart: has anyone looked at sensor performance with these settings in terms of damages?\n - SCIPP has build 4 modules with this and has not seen any sensor damage\n- Conclusion: leave 300g as target for SQ, might change when more sites start getting experience\n - We should add strain relief to petal / stave\n - We will do dip tests to see if this is required, might show that we do not need such high shear strength\n- Page 8: \u00b1200 microns is for stave/petal mounting, so should not be released\n - Position is harder to obtain for barrel with current jigging\n - Bart has developed a 3D printed helper tool to improvements\n- SQ deliverables\n - Did you include pre and post tabbing IV test?\n - Yes! Is included also including DB upload\n - DB actions are on page 13 of talk, please check\n### R5 tooling metrology\n- Toronto and Vancouver sent separately please and spares to Toronto\n- Tested all tools for relative fit as well\n### Metrology Update\n- Page 12: do not key but rely on everyone to stick with what order is defined in metrology document\n- \n### [move to next week] Tuning channel classification criteria for the ABCStar chipset\n- \n### AOB\n- none",
