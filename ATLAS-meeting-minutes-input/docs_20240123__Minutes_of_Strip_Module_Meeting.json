It will depend on what happens with thinner hybrids too. It\u2019s still a possibility, but currently we think Hysol is more likely to help us out.\n- Bart (sl. 4): When we reduce the cycling max temperature, can we really guarantee that the modules won\u2019t go above this? Wouldn\u2019t we want to go up to +30C to see if they would be alright?\n - We want to see what comes out of the Hysol pattern where we can do this with a stave as part of QA. \n- Gerrit (sl. 4): The problem with the higher temperature cycling is also the glue getting pliable. So you end up baking in the stress. All modules cycled up to +40C never really recovered.\n - Luise: I\u2019m only talking in terms of percentage of stress according to the simulation. The high temp is responsible for about 10% of the stress.\n- Bart (still slide 4): The PPB Hybrids are definitely more \u201cwobbly\u201d than the production hybrids. So the production hybrids would be the choice. \n - Luise: Yes, Tony has said they \u201cfeel\u201d stiffer. But if you simulate this, it doesn\u2019t actually affect the stress.\n - Bart: The production hybrids are definitely flatter, so the glue gets applied more evenly. Which corresponds more to what the simulation assumes.\n- Sven (more slide 4): To clarify. The production hybrids are thicker because they have more copper, nothing else. \n - Luise: You said the variation of the production hybrids is batch-to-batch. Is this because of the copper?\n - Sven: Yes, variations are due to the copper in the outer layers to guarantee the vias. \n - Luise: Okay, so production hybrids are the \u201cproper\u201d worst case\n- Carles (sl. 6): The reception test consists of VI and IV right? Many people are just doing the VI, so we can only setting the flag to \u201cPassed\u201d after the IV right?\n - Luise: Yes\n- Pavol (sl. 7): Could this be done with PPA modules?\n - Luise: It should be PPB.\n - Pavol: We have modules for that?\n - Luise: For the EC, we need to build them first, but we can start this for the barrel already.\n - Carles: We have the R4 that you made for us, but broke. It\u2019s only electrically broken, so it might make a good candidate.\n - Pavol: It will take some time, but we can try that.\n - Luise: That would be great, thank you.\n- William: For the paper, is there somewhere where the author list is being built. You said to check if someone is missing, but so far it doesn\u2019t have an author list.\n - Author list is on the paper\n### L4 Updates: ITSDAQ/Sensor/Documentation\n- No updates this week. Pavol will next week.\n### Group Update: Montreal/Toronto\n- Cole (sl. 3): ITSDAQ doesn\u2019t work with influx version 1.8 or 2? That is not correct - it works properly with version 2, please get in touch\n- Cole (sl. 3): for default configurations, please don\u2019t use the outdated old PPB config files, please use the default config files provided by ITSDAQ\n - Dennis: they don\u2019t have crossed HCC bonds yet, need updating\n- Luise: For the LED flexes. I think there are some spares in Freiburg.\n - Dennis: yes, I will send you replacements and you can send me the broken ones when it is convenient.\n - Larelle: Thanks, I\u2019ll send an email with the numbers\n### R3 Module Test Update\n- Ash: Slide 4: how is the HV connection made to the right side?\n - Cole: [explains the scheme]\n - Ash: how is the connection made to the right?\n - Dennis: second physical connection coming out of the powerboard, buried in the testframe\n- Ash: are there 100 Ohm resistors on the output of the powerboard?\n - Dennis: yes, 100 Ohm or 3 kOhm\n - Ash: but are they the same value?\n - Dennis: yes, they are the same\n - Ash: is it in the test frame?\n - Dennis: yes, same as on the petal, so should see the same thing on the petal\n- Vitaliy: two questions: is this the only module with two power converters?\n - Everyone: yes\n- Vitaliy: are the two power conversion circuits exactly the same?\n - Dennis: yes, copy and paste\n - Vitaliy: magnetic field could indicate interactions?\n - Dennis: could be a population issue - they are hand-populate, so there could be population issues - coil orientation has been tried in all permutations\n - Vitaliy: did you bend the legs?\n - Dennis: no, it\u2019s only rotated by 180 degrees or not\n - Vitaliy: so that could be the explanation\n - Dennis: could see it with oscilloscope measurements\n- Luise: we should try to track down where the modules are and check the coil orientations on these and see if they show similar noise behaviour\n - William: are we really thinking interference between the two coils could cause this?\n - Dennis: it is possible, but the sharp turn-on at cold temperatures is weird\n - William: but it could be interference between the two coils?\n - Dennis: it is possible; there are things we can do, e.g. change the switching frequency\n- Dennis: did you actually measure at the centre shield box?\n - Cole: was always in the same position, did not move between tests, was always in the same place\n - Dennis: would be good to repeat measurements with coil over each individual shield box\n### Use of Sleeves for EndCap Modules with Wider Gap\n- Luise: To confirm, we ordered four of each for each site. Should arrive today and we can send them out right away so people can try them.\n- Vitaliy: what\u2019s the spatial precision on these parts?\n - Pete: I actually don\u2019t know. I just visually looked at them.\n - Carles: I don\u2019t recall the name of the plastics, but the white one had machining marks and wall-thicknesses that caused issues. We tried to machine both, but one did not survive. I agree, we may want to remove the top part or we may experience collisions.\n - Carles: I also put kapton on top of the sleeve to create a little bit of gap. \n- Carles: using sleeves\n - Luise: For now, we may want to try it first before we make this permanent (once we know it\u2019s going to work.\n - Carles: once we want to make permanent changes, we could use pins with wider diameter (sharing a picture) for permanent changes\n - Pete: Are those made of brass\n - Carles: Yes\n - Pete: We are using nylon to prevent damage \n- Pavol: have you tried to 3D print this? It might be more precise:\n - Pete: we are considering it.\n - Pavol: Okay, so we\u2019ll try it.\n - Pete: More yes\n - Pavol: if not, happy to try it as well\n- Marta: has this now been agreed on to be a permanent modification?\n - Luise: We are testing it on the Vancouver and Valencia petals, one each. Then we will decide if this is permanent.\n - Marta: Okay thanks\n### Update on Concave R5 Module Tests\n- Luise: When we tested this in the past, we say steaks in the scan, like common mode noise. Has this been fixed for this module?\n - Dennis: I didn\u2019t have any DAQ-related issues. Independent of this soldering. I just used default configs.\n - Luise: Okay, so if fixing the solder removed the common mode noise, that would be great. And for the high noise, this is for the narrow gap right?\n - Dennis: Yes.\n - Luise: So it would be good to see how this look with a wider gap to see if this is causing the issue.\n - Dennis: There was a gap towards the outside, so I added tin and tested, added more tin and tested, but I didn\u2019t see anything obvious.\n - Luise: Okay, if you could show the burst.\n### Update on Monthly Pull Testing\n- Moved to next week. We finished earlier than planned.\n### AOB\n- None",
